# Funder can bypass contract’s checks by malicious metadata contract that reenter other DAO contract while they are uninitialized

## Summary
Malicious DAO funder can call DAO’s contracts while they are not initialized because Manager.deploy() initialize metadata before them. I believe this has high severity because DAOs contracts can be manipulated if they are not initialized and funder can use this to harm the users. Also the DAOs contracts are upgradable and this issue can have more impact with new updates.

## Vulnerability Detail
The deploy() function in the Manager contract helps create new DAO with the sepcified paramaters by caller. Code deploys 5 proxy contract and initialize them. Funder of the DAO is admin of those contracts and have admin access to functionality in those contracts and can manage them by the rule and limitations specified in the contracts logics. 

Caller to Deploy() function can set arbitrary metadata address for his DAO. Because Manager contract initialize metadata proxy before other 3 contract so when call reaches metadata.initalize() the other 3 contracts is not initialized and malicious metadata contract can call those contracts while they are not initialized and manipulate them.

The impact of the bug can vary based on the 3 contract logic code. Malicious funder can initialized them himself and perform some action and reset them or call some logics while bypassing the limits and setting wrong values in contract’s state. Because logics in the contracts are written based on the fact that contract is initialized then calling them when contract isn’t initialized would be dangerous. Malicious funder can create a bad DAO that bypass nounce builder limits and checks and harm the users.


```javascript
        IBaseMetadata(metadata).initialize({ initStrings: _tokenParams.initStrings, token: token });
        IAuction(auction).initialize({
```

This is the POC for issue:
1. maliciouc DAO create maliciouc metaData contract that in init function calls other DAO contracts and manipulate them
2. malicious DAO deployes new DAO by defining his malicious metadata
3. Manager.deploy() calls metaData.init() while other 3 contract is not initialized
4. malicious metaData contract can call other 3 deployed contract while they are not initialized


## Impact
Malicious funder can create DAOs while bypassing funder access limit that is enforced by Nounce protocol contracts and harm the users.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
vim

## Recommendation
Reorder the initialization process to initialize metadata after other contracts (auction, treasury, and governor) to mitigate the potential risk of manipulation by a malicious founder.
