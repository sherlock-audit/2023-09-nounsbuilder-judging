# The new auction settings are applied to the current active auction

## Summary
The new settings are applied to the current auction, they may not be acceptable to users, but the user's transaction is already in the mempool
## Vulnerability Detail
uppose the current value of minBidIncrement is 10%.
1. The DAO has initiated a vote to decrease the value to 7%.
2. An auction is ongoing. The last bid is 1 ether.
3. A user sees the last bid and knows their bid should be 10% higher. They send 1.1 ether to participate in the auction, making the minimum possible bid.
4. The user's transaction is currently in the mempool. Meanwhile, the DAO accumulates enough votes to reduce the value of minBidIncrement and executes the transaction, pausing the contract. They call setMinimumBidIncrement() and then unpause the contract.
5. The user's transaction gets mined. The user is now the highestBidder.


## Impact
The problem is that the user could have sent less Ether and still participated in the auction. 
I have described the most benign scenario.

It turns out to be unfair to the user, as they sent a transaction knowing the auction had certain parameters, but when the transaction was mined, different parameters were in place.

All settings should apply to the next auctions.

I want to note that the settings are changed when the contract is paused, but users can still place bids during this time

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply the new settings to the next auction, which will start after the completion of the current active one.
