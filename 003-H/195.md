# `rewardsManager.depositBatch()` may revert because of precision loss resulting in DOS of auctions

## Summary

The Auction contract computes the total rewards to distributes to the different recipients when settling an auction. But because of how the computation is made the total of fees may differ from the sum of the fees of each recipients. The current implementation of the `rewardsManager` will revert in this case causing a DOS of the auction contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [`Auction.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol) when an auction ends, users can call `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()`  or `settleAuction()` which both call the internal function [`_settleAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L244) to send the bidded ETH to the treasury and the extra recipients and the new NFT to the bidder.

There are multiple recipients: The builder DAO, the refferal address used when bidding and optionally the founders.
They each get a percentage of the bidded ETH and then the rest is sent to the treasury.

To determine the amount sent to each extra recipients the [`_computeTotalRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L465) function is called. It computes the rewards for each recipients depending their percentage as well as the `split.totalRewards`.

```solidity
        // Calulate total rewards
        split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;

...

        // Set builder reward
        split.recipients[0] = builderRecipient;
        split.amounts[0] = (_finalBidAmount * builderRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;

        // Set referral reward
        split.recipients[1] = _currentBidRefferal != address(0) ? _currentBidRefferal : builderRecipient;
        split.amounts[1] = (_finalBidAmount * referralRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
```

This is where the issue lies, each recipients amount is determined using their percentage and the total rewards is determined using the total percentage instead of the sum of all recipients amounts. If precision loss happen (which can happen, see poc) on one of the recipients amounts but not on the total amount then the sum of recipients amount will differ from the total rewards.

```solidity
        uint256 expectedTotalValue;

        for (uint256 i; i < numRecipients; ) {
            expectedTotalValue += amounts[i];

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        if (msg.value != expectedTotalValue) {
            revert INVALID_DEPOSIT();
        }
```

And if we take a look at the current implementation of the [`rewardsManager`'s `depositBatch()` function](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/blob/16a753c9e1046d4430203771770d45dcb353d0f7/packages/protocol-rewards/src/ProtocolRewards.sol#L46) we can see that it will revert if the sum doesn't match the total ETH sent even by just 1 wei.

## Impact

Medium. Auction contract will be DOS and last bidder funds will be locked until a new auction implementation is deployed by the builder DAO, whitelisted and then the proxy is upgraded by the current DAO. This could take a significant amount of time and would result in a lot of hustle for all DAOs impacted as well as the builder DAO that will have to create, audit and deploy the new implementation asap.

Althrough the `rewardsManager` is not part of the scope it is called by contracts that are part of the scope and thus it is important to aknowledge its behaviour.

POC:

Here is a foundry fuzzing poc that shows how `split.totalRewards` can differ from the sum of recipient's fees:

```solidity
function test_test(uint256 bidPrice, uint256 pbsRecip1, uint256 pbsRecip2) external {
        bidPrice = bound(bidPrice, 0.01 ether, 50 ether);

        pbsRecip1 = bound(pbsRecip1, 0, 2_000); //20% in pbs
        pbsRecip2 = bound(pbsRecip2, 0, 2_000);

        uint256 totalPbs = pbsRecip1 + pbsRecip2;

        uint256 feeTotal = bidPrice * totalPbs / 10_000;
        uint256 feeRecip1 = bidPrice * pbsRecip1 / 10_000;
        uint256 feeRecip2 = bidPrice * pbsRecip2 / 10_000;

        assertEq(feeTotal, feeRecip1 + feeRecip2);
}
```

Example values:
- Bid price in wei: 12572495765071851774
- PBS recipient 1: 262
- PBS recipient 2: 855
- Error: a == b not satisfied [uint]
    - Expected: 1404347776958525842
    - Actual: 1404347776958525843

## Recommendation

Consider making the `split.totalRewards` be a sum of each recipient's rewards instead of computing it from the total percentage.
