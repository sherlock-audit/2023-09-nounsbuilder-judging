# updateFounders doesn't delete all records for all founders from tokenRecipient

## Summary

The function updateFounders first deletes information about the old founders and then calls _addFounders to add the new ones. However, under certain circumstances, records in tokenRecipient for the old founders may persist, allowing them to continue receiving tokens during the vesting period.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L411-L428

This happens because during the iteration on line 414, the variable baseTokenId starts with a value of 0. However, in addFounders, this is not always the case (because of _reservedUntilTokenId) . I am attaching a POC, you can add it into Token.t.sol:

```solidity
    function testUpdateFoundersBug() public 
    {
        setMockFounderParams();
        setMockTokenParamsWithReserve(55);
        setMockAuctionParams();
        setMockGovParams();
        deploy(foundersArr, tokenParams, auctionParams, govParams);
        setMockMetadata();
        
        IManager.FounderParams[] memory newFoundersArr = new IManager.FounderParams[](2);
        newFoundersArr[0] = IManager.FounderParams({
            wallet: address(0x06B59d0b6AdCc6A5Dc63553782750dc0b41266a3),
            ownershipPct: 0,
            vestExpiry: 2556057600
        });
        newFoundersArr[1] = IManager.FounderParams({
            wallet: address(0x06B59d0b6AdCc6A5Dc63553782750dc0b41266a3),
            ownershipPct: 10,
            vestExpiry: 2556057600
        });

        vm.prank(address(founder));
        token.updateFounders(newFoundersArr);

        //you can see the address of the old founder but it should be removed
        console.log("Address: %s", token.getScheduledRecipient(57).wallet);
        console.log("Address: %s", token.getScheduledRecipient(56).wallet);

        assertEq(token.getFounders().length, 1);
    }
```

In NounsBuilderTest.sol, I have previously modified the setMockFounderParams function to use a percentage of 34 for the first founder: 

```solidity
    function setMockFounderParams() internal virtual {
        address[] memory wallets = new address[](2);
        uint256[] memory percents = new uint256[](2);
        uint256[] memory vestingEnds = new uint256[](2);

        wallets[0] = founder;
        wallets[1] = founder2;

        //percents[0] = 10;
        percents[0] = 34;
        percents[1] = 5;

        vestingEnds[0] = 4 weeks;
        vestingEnds[1] = 4 weeks;

        setFounderParams(wallets, percents, vestingEnds);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol because of the minted tokens for the old founder.
