# wrong token minting for funders if updateFounders() is called

## Summary
function `updateFounders()` update the list of allocation owners. first it removes the previous allocations that are set by `addFounders()` and then code set the new allocation owners, but code removing the previous allocation owners wrongly so the final result will be wrong and won't be the allocations that caller wanted. this would result in wrong NFT distribution and some user would lose their NFTs. it may even cause minting of tokens to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `_addFounders()` add founders and compute their vesting allocations, this is done by reserving an mapping of [0-100] token indices, such that if a new token mint ID % 100 is reserved, it's sent to the appropriate founder. when code wants to calculate the mapping of each founder code start by index `reservedUntilTokenId` as you see in _addFounders()` code:
```javascript
                // Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;

                // For each token to vest:
                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);

                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;

                    emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
but when function `updateFounders()` tries to remove the old mapping it start with the index 0 for the value of `baseTokenId`:
```javascript
                // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
                uint256 baseTokenId;

                for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
                    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
                        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
                    }

                    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
                    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

                    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
so clearly this won't remove all the mapping and some mappings would remain in the `tokenRecipient[]` mapping from previous founders list. this would cause two issues:
1. the final ownership allocation would be wrong and some uses would receive more tokens.
2. it would be possible that 100% of tokens would be set for founders and then minting tokens for auction would result in unlimited loop.

the second issue would happen when the remaining mappings and the new funder's mapping cover the 100% of the tokens allocation.

## Impact
the token distribution would be wrong and also contract may be in a broken state and no new token would be minted for auctions as all allocation may be assigned to founders.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
fix the `updateFounders()` and start the `reservedUntilTokenId`. 
or simply loop through all the 100 items in the mapping and delete them instead of trying to simulate the `addFounders()`.
