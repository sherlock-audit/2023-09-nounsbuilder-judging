# the default minimum bid increase percentage is very high and it minimum bid increase can set to be lower than 1%

## Summary
whenever users calls `createBid()` if they didn't increase the previous highest bid by `minBidIncrement` percentage then the call would revert. the issue is that the default value for `minBidIncrement` is 10% and also DAO can't set it to under 1% values. an attacker can use this high limit to buy tokens with discount, attacker just need to create a bid with `floorPrice * 101 / 110` price. then the bid price will be in 10% range of the floor price and if anyone wants to bid higher they need to pay more than market price. by doing this attacker can get tokens up to `minBidIncrement`% discount.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is part of `createBid()` code, as you can see code makes sure that newBid is higher than `lastBid` by `minBidIncrement` percentage:
```javascript
            // Used to store the minimum bid required
            uint256 minBid;

            // Cannot realistically overflow
            unchecked {
                // Compute the minimum bid
                minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100);
            }

            // Ensure the incoming bid meets the minimum
            if (msgValue < minBid) {
                revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
            }
```

the default value for `minBidIncrement` is 10%:
```javascript
    /// @notice Min bid increment BPS
    uint8 private immutable INITIAL_MIN_BID_INCREMENT_PERCENT = 10;
```

suppose the NFT is traded in some DEX after some users received it. so if the `minBidIncrement` was 10%, then if current auction highest bid price was in 10% range of the token market floor price, then no one will bid higher because they will bid higher than market floor price and the highest bid can win the auction. attacker can use this and front run others and set a bid that is 8% lower than floor price and other couldn't bid higher and attacker can buy the token with 8% discount.

even if DAO want to change the value of the `minBidIncrement`, they can't set any value less than 1% and the auction price always have 1% difference with market price.

it's true that if `minBidIncrement` was to low then one can extend the auction duration by small bid increase but this issue should be handled with other technique rather than setting `minBidIncrement`  too high which make auction inefficient.

## Impact
auction price will be inefficient and attacker can buy NFT tokens in auction by up to `minBidIncrement` discount from real token floor price in markets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
lower the default value and also increase the denominator to 10K so it would be possible to set lower values for min bid increase percentage.
