# [H-02] Auctions can be DoSed because of the push method

## Summary

The `_createBid` method can be DoSed because it tries to send the previous highest to the bidder. If this is bricked, the `_createBid` will be uncallable and it will revert every time.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the `_createBid` functions, the push over pull method is used which can lead to bricking the auction. The exact same scenario occurred in the famous [King of The Ether case](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/denial-of-service/). The function tries to refund the previous bidder by directly sending them the amount they bid initially:

```solidity
            // Refund the previous bidder
            _handleOutgoingTransfer(lastHighestBidder, lastHighestBid);
        }

```

The ETH call can easily fail if the bidder is a smart contract that reverts inside a `receive` method. There is an alternative if the ETH call fails, to send WETH which can also fail for different reasons and then the whole call will revert:

```solidity
    function _handleOutgoingTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) private { //@audit -  this can be DoSed
        // Ensure the contract has enough ETH to transfer
        if (address(this).balance < _amount) revert INSOLVENT();

        // Used to store if the transfer succeeded
        bool success;

        assembly {
            // Transfer ETH to the recipient
            // Limit the call to 50,000 gas
            success := call(50000, _to, _amount, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        }

        // If the transfer failed:
        if (!success) {
            // Wrap as WETH
            IWETH(WETH).deposit{ value: _amount }();

            // Transfer WETH instead
            bool wethSuccess = IWETH(WETH).transfer(_to, _amount);

            // Ensure successful transfer
            if (!wethSuccess) {
                revert FAILING_WETH_TRANSFER();
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

An auction can be bricked and not allow any more users to bid for a token.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing pull over push method so users can `claim` their refunds instead of a direct transfer.
