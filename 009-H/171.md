# The founder allocation should be updated after changing `reservedUntilTokenId`.

## Summary
After changing `reservedUntilTokenId` using `Token.setReservedUntilTokenId()`, the founder allocation mechanism wouldn't work as expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner can update `reservedUntilTokenId` using `setReservedUntilTokenId()` before starting the auction.

```solidity
    function setReservedUntilTokenId(uint256 newReservedUntilTokenId) external onlyOwner {
        // Cannot change the reserve after any non reserved tokens have been minted
        // Added to prevent making any tokens inaccessible
        if (settings.mintCount > 0) {
            revert CANNOT_CHANGE_RESERVE();
        }

        // Cannot decrease the reserve if any tokens have been minted
        // Added to prevent collisions with tokens being auctioned / vested
        if (settings.totalSupply > 0 && reservedUntilTokenId > newReservedUntilTokenId) {
            revert CANNOT_DECREASE_RESERVE();
        }

        // Set the new reserve
        reservedUntilTokenId = newReservedUntilTokenId; //@audit should update founder allocations

        emit ReservedUntilTokenIDUpdated(newReservedUntilTokenId);
    }
```

As `reservedUntilTokenId` is used while [adding founders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/tree/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L161), the founder allocation wouldn't work as expected.

1. During the initialization, there was one founder with `ownershipPct = 1, reservedUntilTokenId = 0`.
2. After calling `_addFounders()`, `tokenRecipient[0]` will be booked for the founder.
3. Before starting an auction, `setReservedUntilTokenId()` is called and `reservedUntilTokenId = 1` now.
3. While minting NFTs with an auction, `tokenId` will start from [reservedUntilTokenId = 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/tree/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L235).
4. So the founder wouldn't receive any NFTs while minting 1 to 99 although he should've got one right after the auction starts.

## Impact
The founder allocation mechanism would be broken after changing `reservedUntilTokenId`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should update the founder allocations again after changing `reservedUntilTokenId` in `setReservedUntilTokenId()`.
