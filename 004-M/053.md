# Every participant can always retrieve a portion of their bid money.

## Summary
There is a referral rewards system in place when creating a `bid`. 
However, the absence of limitations on `referrals` can enable users to obtain a portion of their `bid` money.
## Vulnerability Detail
Any user has the ability to create a bid by referring themselves as the referrer.
```solidity
function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
    currentBidReferral = _referral;
    _createBid(_tokenId);
}
```
When settling the current `auction`, we calculate the `rewards` for the `builder`, `referrer`, `founder`, etc.
```solidity
function _settleAuction() private {
    RewardSplits memory split = _computeTotalRewards(currentBidReferral, highestBid, founderReward.percentBps);
    if (split.totalRewards != 0) {
        rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
    }
}
```
In the `_computeTotalRewards` function, we allocate `rewards` to the `referrer` if `currentBidReferral` is set.
```solidity
function _computeTotalRewards(
    address _currentBidRefferal,
    uint256 _finalBidAmount,
    uint256 _founderRewardBps
) internal view returns (RewardSplits memory split) {
    // Set referral reward
    split.recipients[1] = _currentBidRefferal != address(0) ? _currentBidRefferal : builderRecipient;
    split.amounts[1] = (_finalBidAmount * referralRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
}
```
Anyone can retrieve a portion of their bid money by referring themselves as the referrer.
## Impact
Obviously, everyone would prefer to use `createBidWithReferra`l over `createBid`. 
In cases where there is no `referrer`, the `rewards` intended for the `referrer` will be given to the `builder`.
But the `builder` won't receive the `referral reward` as designed in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can add limitations to the `createBidWithReferral` function as follows:
```solidity
function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
    + if (msg.sender == _referral) revert();
}
```
Alternatively, you could impose additional restrictions on `referrers`. 
For instance, you could define allowed `referrals` or restrict users to referring others only in their first `auction`.
