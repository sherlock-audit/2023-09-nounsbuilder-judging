# No validation for referral address

## Summary
In auction smart contract, there is no validation for referral addresses when creating bid, so there won't be any reason for bidders to bid with appropriate referral address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In auction smart contract, bidders are to set a referral address so that the referral address could get reward when the bidder wins the auction.
However, there isn't any validation for referral addresses, so bidders will just set their address as referral address to receive a portion of final bid amount back.

## Impact
Correct referrals won't receive their rewards but any arbitrary address can.
