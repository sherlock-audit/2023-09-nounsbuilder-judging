# Bidder can set their address as a referral to earn rewards

## Summary

Bidders have the option to designate their address as a referral in order to receive rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

In `createBidWithReferral()`, any bidder can set `_referral` argument to its own address in order to earn referral rewards.

## Impact

The reward earned by the bidder by doing so represents a loss for the builder. This is because, if there is no referral associated with the highest bid, the referral reward is attributed to the builder, as indicated in the code snippet [`Auction.sol#L500`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L500):
` split.recipients[1] = _currentBidRefferal != address(0) ? _currentBidRefferal : builderRecipient;`

## Code Snippet

[`Auction.sol#L144`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L144C1-L144C1)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a check in `createBidWithReferral()`  to prevent this scenario, and implement a new custom error for such cases.

```solidity
function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
        if(_referral == msg.sender) revert INVALID_REFERRAL()
        currentBidReferral = _referral;
        _createBid(_tokenId);
}

```
