# Due to the revert in function `_handleOutgoingTransfer`, malicious bidders will successfully bid at a lower price.

## Summary

Due to the revert from the malicious bidder's receive  function, subsequent bidding will fail, which will ultimately lead to the malicious bidder succeeding in bidding at a lower price.

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `_handleOutgoingTransfer`, ETH will be returned to the previous bidder. However, an attacker can maliciously fail to receive, for example, use a smart contract as the receiving address, and maliciously revert in the receive function.

```solidity
// If the transfer failed:
        if (!success) {
            // Wrap as WETH
            IWETH(WETH).deposit{ value: _amount }();

            // Transfer WETH instead
            bool wethSuccess = IWETH(WETH).transfer(_to, _amount);

            // Ensure successful transfer
            if (!wethSuccess) {
                revert FAILING_WETH_TRANSFER();
            }
        }
```

Later, the `revert FAILING_WETH_TRANSFER()` in function `_handleOutgoingTransfer` will cause the new bidder to fail. In the end, the malicious bidder succeeded in bidding at a lower price.

## Impact

The bidding rules were broken, allowing bidders to successfully bid at a lower price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the `revert FAILING_WETH_TRANSFER()` in function `_handleOutgoingTransfer` 

```solidity
if (!success) {
   // Wrap as WETH
   IWETH(WETH).deposit{ value: _amount }();

   // Transfer WETH instead
   IWETH(WETH).transfer(_to, _amount);
}
```
