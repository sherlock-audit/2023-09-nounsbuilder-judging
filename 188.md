# Referral bonus can be gamed (by acting as a discount to the bidder).

## Summary

Referral bonus can be gamed (by acting as a discount to the bidder). To be precise, the bidder can just put the bidder's own address as the referral address to gain the referral bonus back.

## Vulnerability Detail

There's no check on validity of the referral address, so the bidder can just input own address to get the referral bonus.

## Impact

The referral bonus will just decrease the total bid value since everyone is better off referring to themselves.

## Recommendation
Some mitigations include:
- Remove referral altogether, since it's easily gameable
- Only allow whitelisted referral addresses
