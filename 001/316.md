# reservedUntilTokenId set below 100 breaks reserve functionality


## Summary
In `Token.sol`, `reservedUntilTokenId` is an important parameter used to determine which tokenIds are reserved. When `reservedUntilTokenId` is set to less than 100, some tokenIds for reserved founders will incorrectly exceed `reservedUntilTokenId` and prevent founders from minting their reserved tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
By design, the`reservedUntilTokenId` should be the first tokenId that the DAO's auctions will use. If it was set to 100 then it means that tokenIds 0 to 99 are reserved and auctions will begin at 100.

Due to the way that `Token.sol` uses `% 100` to calculate tokenId, when `reservedUntilTokenId` is set to less than 100, tokenIds **greater than** the `reservedUntilTokenId`will be inadvertently reserved for founders, breaking core functionality.
```solidity
// if baseTokenId = 50 and schedule = 10, then next baseTokenId = 60 (greater than 50)
baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;	
```

Proof-of-concept:
Consider this scenario, assume a DAO is created with 2 founders, founder1 10% ownership, founder2 5% ownership and `reservedUntilTokenId = 50`

Founder1 will have have tokenIds 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 reserved for him.
Founder2 will have tokenId, 51, 71, 91, 11, 31 reserved to him.

This goes against the design that any tokenIds above 50 should not be reserved.

Run this foundry test in `Token.t.sol`
```solidity
function test_tokenIdsExceedReserve() public {
	uint256 _reservedUntilTokenId = 50;	
	deployAltMock(_reservedUntilTokenId);	  
	
	(address wallet50,,) = token.tokenRecipient(50);	
	(address wallet60,,) = token.tokenRecipient(60);	
	(address wallet51,,) = token.tokenRecipient(51);	
	(address wallet52,,) = token.tokenRecipient(52);	
	(address wallet71,,) = token.tokenRecipient(71);
		  	
	assertTrue(wallet50 == address(founder));	
	assertTrue(wallet60 == address(founder));	
	assertTrue(wallet51 == address(founder2));	
	assertTrue(wallet52 == address(0));	
	assertTrue(wallet71 == address(founder2));
}
```
## Impact
Founders cannot mint the bulk of their reserved tokens through mintFromReserve because if tokenId is > `reservedUntilTokenId`,`mintFromReserveTo` will revert. This has significant implications as the `MerkleReserveMinter.sol` uses the `mintFromReserveTo` function to mint tokens to founders.

```solidity
function mintFromReserveTo(address recipient, uint256 tokenId) external nonReentrant {
	// Token must be reserved
	if (tokenId >= reservedUntilTokenId) revert TOKEN_NOT_RESERVED();
```

## Recommendation
Handle scenarios where `reservedUntilTokenId` is less than 100 in `addFounders`. Alternatively, add a requirement that `reservedUntilTokenId` must be at least 100
