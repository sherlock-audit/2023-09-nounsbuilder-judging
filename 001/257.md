# the first founder can't mint his all reserved tokenid

## Summary
the first founder can't mint his all reserved basedtoken 
## Vulnerability Detail
the function **_addFounders**   is used to add founders and reserve for them some **tokenid**  and  it will start from the  **reservedUntilTokenId**   to do the process   it will set **baseTokenId** as  **reservedUntilTokenId** on line 161 then there is a second loop  which will give them some allocation on the **reservedUntilTokenId** based on there percentages  and updates  the **tokenRecipient**   mapping and when doing that it will first call **_getNextTokenId** to check the **basetokennId** is already initialized   or not since we are initializing for the first time    the **basetokenId** IS NOT USED  BEFORE SO **_getNextTokenId** will  return  **reservedUntilTokenId**
and tokenRecipient will be updated with the  **reservedUntilTokenId**    so if the founder uses  **mintFromReserve**  in the **MarkleReserveMinter** contract which uses **Token.mintFromReserve ** it will revert because in the function **mintFromReserve**  the if statement checks if the **tokenid** is **reservedUntilTokenId** if it is it will revert 

        _`if (tokenId >= reservedUntilTokenId) revert TOKEN_NOT_RESERVED();`_

## Impact
the founder will not get his token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
on the  **_getNextTokenId** check if  the **tokenid** is the same as **reservedUntilTokenId**
