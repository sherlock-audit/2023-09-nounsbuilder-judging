# Founder may receive 1 less token for every 100 tokens minted

## Summary
Founder may receive 1 less token for every 100 tokens minted.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Founder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/types/TokenTypesV1.sol#L30-L34)'s `ownershipPct` decides how many tokens will be minted to a founder for every 100 tokens. For example, if `ownershipPct` is **1**, founder can get **1** token if there are 100 tokens minted.

In [_addFounders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L120-L182) function, founder is stored in `tokenRecipient` by iterating the founder's `ownershipPct`:
```solidity
                // Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;


                // For each token to vest:
                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);


                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;


                    emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);


                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
Founder can get tokens by [minting with vesting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L230-L243):
```solidity
            do {
                // Get the next token to mint
                tokenId = reservedUntilTokenId + settings.mintCount++;


                // Lookup whether the token is for a founder, and mint accordingly if so
            } while (_isForFounder(tokenId));
```
[_isForFounder]() function is called to check if current token should be sent to a founder, the steps are:
1. Get the base token id: `baseTokenId = _tokenId % 100`;
2. Check if there is no scheduled recipient: `tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].wallet == address(0)`;
3. If there is, check if the founder is still vesting: `block.timestamp < tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].vestExpiry`;
4. If yes, mint the token to the founder: `_mint(tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].wallet, _tokenId)`

Because `baseTokenId` here equals `_tokenId % 100`, it is expected that a founder stored in `tokenRecipient` should never be pointed by a key value larger or equal to **100**, however, it is no always the case.

Let's review how `tokenRecipient[baseTokenId]` is populated in `_addFounders` function:
```solidity
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;

                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);


                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;
```
And step into [_getNextTokenId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L186-L194) function:
```solidity
    function _getNextTokenId(uint256 _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        unchecked {
            while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
                _tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
            }


            return _tokenId;
        }
    }
```
So the problem is if `reservedUntilTokenId` is larger than or equal to **100**, the same value will be returned by `_getNextTokenId` function and assigned to `baseTokenId`, which is in turn stored in `tokenRecipient` and results a founder is pointed by a key value larger than or equal to **100** .

Let's assume:
1. A founder's `ownershipPct` is 2, and the `reservedUntilTokenId` is `100`;
2. founder is stored in `tokenRecipient[50]` and `tokenRecipient[100]`;
3. When mints a token, because `baseTokenId` is less than **100**, no value will be get from `tokenRecipient[100]`;
4. Founder will only get 1 token for every 100 tokens minted, even if the founder's `ownershipPct` is 2.

## Impact
If `reservedUntilTokenId` is larger than **100** and founder's `ownershipPct` is 1, no matter how many tokens are minted, the founder will not get any tokens.
If `reservedUntilTokenId` is larger than **100** and founder's `ownershipPct` is larger than 1, the founder will get 1 less token for every 100 tokens minted.

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, please make sure `baseTokenId` is always less than **100** when stores founder in `tokenRecipient[baseTokenId]`.
