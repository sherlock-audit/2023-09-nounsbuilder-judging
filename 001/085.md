# inconsistent handling funders with 0 pct ownership in addFounders() and updateFounders()

## Summary
function `addFounders()` doesn't add funders with 0 pct ownership to the funders list but `updateFounders()` would handle funder with 0 pct in the founders list. it seems that code assumes there would exists funders with 0 percentage ownership but because of the issue in the `addFounders()` those funder won't be included in the founders list and it my result in empty founders list.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is pat of `addFounders()` code, as you can see when founder's pct is zero code just ignore those funders.
```javascript
            for (uint256 i; i < _founders.length; ++i) {
                // Cache the percent ownership
                uint256 founderPct = _founders[i].ownershipPct;

                // Continue if no ownership is specified
                if (founderPct == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
```
This is pat of `updateFounders()` code, as you can see code handles the situations that there is funders with 0 pct in the list, and according to the comment some DAOS will be initialized with 0 percentage ownership.
```javascript
            // for each existing founder:
            for (uint256 i; i < cachedFounders.length; ++i) {
                // copy the founder into memory
                Founder memory cachedFounder = cachedFounders[i];

                // Delete the founder from the stored mapping
                delete founder[i];

                // Some DAOs were initialized with 0 percentage ownership.
                // This skips them to avoid a division by zero error.
                if (cachedFounder.ownershipPct == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
```

clearly this a inconsistent handling of the 0 percentage funder ownerships. this would result 0 length funder list, and any logic depending on the funders list would be broken.

## Impact
funders list would be wrong and won't be showing the real funder list and it can cause issues for zero ownership DAOs and for DAO migerations too.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
add 0 pct founders to the list or clearly say in the docs and comments that those founders will be ignored and won't be included in the list.
