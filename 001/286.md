# Incorrect vesting allocations clearing when the list of allocations updating

## Summary
The difference in start value of the `baseTokenId` at the `Token.updateFounders` and `Token._addFounders` functions can lead to incorrect allocation clearing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Token.updateFounders` updates the list of allocation owners by clearing the previous allocations before adding new.
The function reverse engineers the indices the founder has reserved tokens in. But the initial value for the `baseTokenId` is always `0` while during the allocation itself the `baseTokenId` depends on the `reservedUntilTokenId` variable.
```solidity
160                // Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
161                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;
...
411                // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
412                uint256 baseTokenId;
```
Thus the difference in start value can lead to incorrect indices calculation.

## Impact
Some allocations may not be cleared and addresses from the previous list of allocations will receive an excess amount of tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `reservedUntilTokenId` as a start value of `baseTokenId`.
