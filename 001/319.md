# Potential OwnershipPct Loss Due to Out-of-Range Assignment of `baseTokenId`

## Summary

The incorrect handling of `baseTokenId` in `Token.sol::_addFounders` when the `reservedUntilTokenId` is larger than 99, leading to a loss of 1 percent point in ownership for the affected founder.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `_getNextTokenId` function expects `_tokenId` input to be within the [0-99] range in order for `tokenRecipient[_tokenId]` to read valid data. If `_tokenId` is larger than 99, the `tokenRecipient` would always read empty data, leading to the comparison at line 188 always result to False and the `_getNextTokenId` function returning the same out-of-range `_tokenId`. This creates a false assumption that `_tokenId` is actually the next valid tokenId, but instead its value could be 101 or larger.

```solidity
// File: nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol
186:    function _getNextTokenId(uint256 _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
187:        unchecked {
188:            while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {// <= FOUND
189:                _tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
190:            }
191:
192:            return _tokenId;
        ...
194:    }
``` 

On the other hand, we have `_addFounders` calls `_getNextTokenId` function with `baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId`. For example, if the `reservedUntilTokenId` was set as 111, `tokenRecipient` at line 169 would store `newFounder` to the index of 111, affectively making it inaccessible in subsequent `_isForFounder` check. As a result, one token is left out and could never be minted. This loss prevents the first founder (who has a positive founderPct) from minting their corresponding base token, resulting in a 1 percent point loss in ownership.

```solidity
// File: nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol
120:    function _addFounders(IManager.FounderParams[] calldata _founders, uint256 reservedUntilTokenId) internal {
        ...
161:                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId; // <= @audit
162:
163:                // For each token to vest:
164:                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
165:                    // Get the available token id
166:                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId); // @audit: _getNextTokenId returns reservedUntilTokenId on 1st call
167:
168:                    // Store the founder as the recipient
169:                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder; // @audit: tokenRecipient alloc newFounder to reservedUntilTokenId index which is potentially out-of-range
175:                }
            ...
182:    }
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is severe. The first founder with a positive `founderPct` will lose 1 token due to the incorrect initial assignment of the unverified `reservedUntilTokenId` to `baseTokenId` which is could be out-of-range.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended NOT to assign `reservedUntilTokenId` to `baseTokenId` to prevent the loss of ownership percentage for the first founder.
