# First Founder unable to mint token due to tokenId incorrectly set to reservedUntilTokenId

## Summary
When adding founders during `Token.sol` initialization, the first founder will have his first tokenId set to reservedUntilTokenId. This has two consequences 1) the first founder cannot mint his first token using `mintFromReserveTo`, and 2) reservedUntilTokenId will incorrectly point to a reserved token.
## Vulnerability Detail

By design, the`reservedUntilTokenId` should be the first tokenId that the DAO's auctions will use. If it was set to 100 then it means that tokenIds 0 to 99 are reserved. 
```solidity
/// @param _reservedUntilTokenId The tokenId that a DAO's auctions will start at
```

The error lies in the function `_addFounders`. Unlike subsequent tokens, this first reserved token does not go through `% 100` and therefore is set to be equal to `reservedUntilTokenId`. E.g. if `reservedUntilTokenId = 100`, the first founder's first reserved token will be id `100`.

```solidity
function _addFounders() internal {
	...	
	// @audit first founder's first tokenId set to reservedUntiltokenId
	uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;	  
	
	for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {	
		// @audit tokenId is unchanged by _getNextTokenId since token is unassigned
		baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);	
		tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;  
		
		emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);  
			
		// @audit only subsequent tokenIds have the % 100 treatment
		baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;	
	}
}

function _getNextTokenId(uint256 _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
	unchecked {
		while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
		_tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
		} 
		
		return _tokenId;
	}
}
```

## Impact
The first founder is unable to mint his first token through `mintFromReserveTo`as it would fail the check:

```solidity
 if (tokenId >= reservedUntilTokenId) revert TOKEN_NOT_RESERVED();
```

Consider this proof-of-concept:
- Assume `reservedUntilTokenId = 100`
- After adding founders, it is checked that tokenId 100 belongs to the first founder
- If minter tries to mint tokenId 100 to founder, it will revert with "TOKEN_NOT_RESERVED"

Add this foundry test to `Token.t.sol`
```solidity
function test_cannotMintFirstToken() public {	
	uint256 _reservedUntilTokenId = 100;	
	deployAltMock(_reservedUntilTokenId);	  
	
	(address wallet100,,) = token.tokenRecipient(100);	
	assertTrue(wallet100 == address(founder));	  
	
	address _minter = vm.addr(0x1234);	
	TokenTypesV2.MinterParams[] memory minters = new TokenTypesV2.MinterParams[](1);	
	TokenTypesV2.MinterParams memory p1 = TokenTypesV2.MinterParams({ minter: _minter, allowed: true });	
	minters[0] = p1;	  
	
	vm.prank(address(founder));	
	token.updateMinters(minters);  
	
	vm.startPrank(minters[0].minter);  
	
	bytes4 selector = bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("TOKEN_NOT_RESERVED()")));
	
	vm.expectRevert(selector);	
	// First founder cannot mint first tokenId	
	token.mintFromReserveTo(founder, 100);
}
```

Considering that the first founder is very likely an important person in the DAO, losing some ownership due to failure to mint a token is quite impactful. The likelihood is also high or even bound to occur due to the very first reserved tokenId being incorrectly set to `reservedForTokenId`.

## Recommendation
Consider changing `_addFounders()` from:

`uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;`
to
`uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId % 100;
