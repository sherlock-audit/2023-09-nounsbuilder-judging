# Updating founders may unexpectedly leave ownership for previous founders

## Summary
Updating founders may not correctly delete ownership/token assignment for previous founders potentially leaving unintended token assignments.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Token.sol`, `updateFounders` first intends to remove all existing token assignments before adding a new configuration
for founder token vesting. However, the removal starts from token id `0` which is inconsistent with the token id calculation logic when adding founders which starts from `reservedUntilTokenId`.

```solidity
                uint256 schedule = 100 / cachedFounder.ownershipPct;

                // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
                uint256 baseTokenId;

                for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
                    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
                        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
                    }

                    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
                    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

                    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
Consequently, the `baseTokenId` is not reverse engineered accurately and incorrect values are deleted in the `tokenRecipient` mapping. This could result in previous founders retaining vested tokens despite not being assigned in the new founders vesting configuration.

## Impact
Previous founders could retain assignment for vested tokens (and consequently, unintentionally, be minted these tokens) despite updating the founder configuration.

## Recommendation
Initialise `baseTokenId` to `reservedUntilTokenId`.
