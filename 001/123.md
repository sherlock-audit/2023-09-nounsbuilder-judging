# Update Founders deletes wrong founders Tokens, leading to wrong distribution

## Summary

Calling updateFounders() function in Token.sol to update founders might not clear TokenIds properly. This can result in some tokens not getting cleared and incorrect tokenIDs being assigned, causing distribution percentages to be wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

Following for loop inside of updateFounder() is used to clear the old founders tokens, so that afterwards when adding the founders again the addFounders function can reassign them.

```solidity

// Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
                uint256 baseTokenId; //@audit does not include reservedUntilTokenId

                for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
                    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
                        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
                    }

                    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
                    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

                    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }

```
As we can see the baseTokenId does not include the reservedUntilTokenId, so it will start at 0.

Example:
If reservedUntilTokenId = 5 and we add 2 founders with 10%.
With addFounders the founders will get the following baseTokenIds assigned:

First Founder: 5,15,25,35,45,55,65,75,85,95
Second Founder: 6,16,26,36,46,56,66,76,86,96

But when updateFounders is called it is deleting the following ids for these founders from the tokenRecipientsmapping:

For first founder: 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90
For second: 1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91

so basically it is not deleting their assignments, and then addFounder is called again with the new founders, but there might be some old assignments left.

Following POC can be added to the tests inside of the repo:

## Impact

Founder tokens are wrongly distributed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Start the calc at reservedUntil:

```solidity
uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;
```
