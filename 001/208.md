# Founders baseTokenId will be less than reservedUntilTokenId.

## Summary
One of the protocol invariants is that Founders baseTokenId must be greater than reservedUntilTokenId. But after the 1st founder’s basetokenid,  others founder’s basetokenid will be less than reservedUntilTokenId.


## Vulnerability Detail
Let assume the function _addFounders(Token contract) is called with two founders and 1st founder’s  ownershipPct is 50% , 2nd founder’s ownershipPct is 48%, reservedUntilTokenId is 500.

Now 1st founder’s schedule = 100/50 = 2.
baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(500) = 500.
tokenRecipient[500] = newFounder;
So the 1st founder’s baseTokenId is 500.
2nd founder’s baseTokenId set as (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100 i.e (500+2)%100 = 2.
So the 2nd founder’s baseTokenId will be now 2 which is less than reservedUntilTokenId.


## Impact
This will collude with reserve tokeid which breaks the invariant of the protocol.

## Recommendation
When calculating basetokenid, make sure/validate that  founders baseTokenId is always greater than reservedUntilTokenId.
