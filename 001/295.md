# Malfunction in updateFounders

## Summary

updateFounders in Token.sol is not respecting the reserveUntilTokenId, which leads to a wrong cleanup of baseTokenIds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In updateFounders there is a loop in the code, that is deleting the baseTokenIds, on when to mint tokens for founders. This is to ensure, that the mapping is clean, before adding the update founders. The problem here is, that this function is not respecting the changes, that where done to the addFounders in regards to the reservedUntilTokenId. 

When adding, the baseTokenId stars with the value set to reservedUntilTokenId, but when deleting it starts with baseTokenId=0.

This will result in the mapping to not be properly cleaned, and old founders to may still receive tokens, or updated founders receiving too many tokens.

## Impact

- Old founders may receive tokens
- Founders may receive too many tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

use the same baseId for deletion as for adding the founders, starting with reservedUntilTokenId
