# BaseTokenID is wrongfully set to reservedUntilTokenId

## Summary
In `Token.sol` function `_addFounders` contains line of code `uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;` , however if we delve deeper into what this line of code does we will see problems arise.

## Vulnerability Detail
We know that `baseTokenId` should be a number between 0 and 100 & the tokens for the founders should be applied after the reserve. However if we have `reservedUntilTokenId`  is greater than 100 which is not rare (in a case where there are more than 100 reserved tokens for minters). This is where the problem starts. 
## Impact
``` solidity
for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {

// Get the available token id

baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);

  

// Store the founder as the recipient

tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;

  

emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);
```
the code will wrongfully start at the wrong `baseTokenId` and will start counting from there (instead of storing `baseTokenId` starting from 0) also it will emit  `MintScheduled` which will take the wrong parameters considering it takes `baseTokenId` and `Newfounder` which has the incorrect `baseTokenId` stored. 

This will cause the `MintScheduled` to have a different `BaseTokenId`than the `MintUnscheduled`, obviously we want `MintScheduled` to be the same as `MintUnscheduled` (also confirmed this on discord with the devs). 

We also do not want the `BaseTokenId`to ever exceed 100, but since the first `BaseTokenId` goes into the loop and gets stored in `MintScheduled` before going through the % 100 this means it will take the same number as `reservedUntilTokenId`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
``` solidity
// Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
uint256 baseTokenId = 0;
```
