# updateFounders can be called after handing over control to the DAO

## Summary
The `updateFounders` function is used by the owner to update the list of founders, which presumably happens before handing control over to the DAO based on [docs](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/nouns-builder/creating#:~:text=before%20handing%20off%20control%20to%20the%20DAO.).
 
Due to a lack of checks in the `updateFounders` function however, it can still be called after control is handed over to the DAO and after tokens have been minted to founders. This could cause chaos in the DAO and incorrect ownership distribution among founders. 

## Vulnerability Detail
No guards or checks are in place in `updateFounders` to check if `settings.mintCount > 0` or `settings.totalSupply > 0`, which would imply that founders have been minted tokens or that control has been handed over to the DAO.

``` solidity
function updateFounders(IManager.FounderParams[] calldata newFounders) external onlyOwner 
````

This is also inconsistent with another critical onlyOwner function `setReservedUntilTokenId` which **does** implement these checks:

``` solidity
function setReservedUntilTokenId(uint256 newReservedUntilTokenId) external onlyOwner {

	if (settings.mintCount > 0) {	
		revert CANNOT_CHANGE_RESERVE();	
	}	
	
	if (settings.totalSupply > 0 && reservedUntilTokenId > newReservedUntilTokenId) {	
		revert CANNOT_DECREASE_RESERVE();
}
```
## Impact
Consider this scenario:
1. Due to politics within the DAO, a vote is passed to `updateFounders` with intention to add another founder
2. DAO does not realize that one founder already has a token minted to him
3. As previous founder allocations are cleared and re-added, the founder with a token already has another token reserved for him. That founder now has more ownership than intended

As founder allocations and ownership are critical elements of a DAO, such a function should have necessary guards in place to prevent misuse or accidents.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the same guards and checks as in the function `setReservedUntilTokenId()`.
