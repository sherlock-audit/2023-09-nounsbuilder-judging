# In the function `updateFounders`, the baseTokenId corresponding to the previous founder's share is calculated incorrectly

## Summary

In the function `updateFounders`, the baseTokenId corresponding to the previous founder's share is calculated incorrectly

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `updateFounders`,  the `baseTokenId` is initialized to 0 instead of the reservedUntilTokenId (which is used in _addFounders). It causes the subsequently calculated baseTokenId to be inconsistent with the baseTokenId corresponding to the previous founders.

```solidity
// Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
uint256 baseTokenId;

for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
    }

    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

    // Update the base token id
    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
}
```

For example, when reservedUntilTokenId = 21 and the previous founder is only Alice and hold 10% of the shares, so the baseTokenIds corresponding to Alice is 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 1, 11 (calculated in _addFounders). However, in `updateFounders`, calculated baseTokenIds are 0, 10, 20, 30, …, 90. Ultimately, the previous founder’s shares are not deleted.

The effect of this example is that the previous founder's share is retained. In addition, it is possible that new founders cannot obtain shares (because the shares of previous founders have not been deleted), resulting in an infinite loop in _addFounders.

## Impact

previous founder's share is retained, DOS (and possibly more)

## Recommendation

Initialize the baseTokenId with reservedUntilTokenId in function _addFounders.

```solidity
// Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;

for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
    }

    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

    // Update the base token id
    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
}
```
