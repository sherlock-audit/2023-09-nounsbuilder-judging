# Token.updateFounders() might clear the wrong tokenRecipient[baseTokenId], as a result, not all old founders might be deleted.

## Summary
Token.updateFounders() might clear the wrong tokenRecipient[baseTokenId], as a result, not all old founders might be deleted. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``Token.updateFounders()`` will allow the owner to delete the list of old founders and add a new set of founders. It uses reverse engineering to find which ``tokenRecipient[baseTokenId]`` to clear. The problem is that for each founder, it starts from ``baseTokenId = 0`` instead of from ``baseTokenId =  reservedUntilTokenId``.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L412](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L412)

This is not consistent with function  ``addFounders()``, which starts from ``baseTokenId =  reservedUntilTokenId`` for each founder to find   the available entry in ``tokenRecipient``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L161](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L161)

As a result, the wrong ``tokenRecipient[baseTokenId]`` will be deleted by updateFounders() while some existing founders will not be deleted from ``tokenRecipient``. The final result might have more founders than desired. 


## Impact

The wrong ``tokenRecipient[baseTokenId]`` will be deleted by updateFounders() while some existing founders will not be deleted from ``tokenRecipient``. The final result might have more founders than desired.

## Recommendation

 starts from ``baseTokenId =  reservedUntilTokenId`` to find the baseTokenId for each founder:

```diff

        // Cannot realistically overflow
        unchecked {
            // Add each founder to the array
            for (uint256 i; i < numFounders; ++i) {
                cachedFounders[i] = founder[i];
            }
        }

        // Keep a mapping of all the reserved token IDs we're set to clear.
        bool[] memory clearedTokenIds = new bool[](100);

        unchecked {

                Founder memory cachedFounder = cachedFounders[i];

                // Delete the founder from the stored mapping
                delete founder[i];

                    continue;
                }

                // using the ownership percentage, get reserved token percentages
                uint256 schedule = 100 / cachedFounder.ownershipPct;

                // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
-                uint256 baseTokenId;

                    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
                    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
                        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
                    }

                    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
                    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

                    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
            }
        }

        // Clear values from storage before adding new founders
        settings.numFounders = 0;
        settings.totalOwnership = 0;
        emit FounderAllocationsCleared(newFounders);

        _addFounders(newFounders, reservedUntilTokenId);
    }
