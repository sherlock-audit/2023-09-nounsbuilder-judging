# Founder may not be able to receive tokens even if the founder has one percentage of token ownership

## Summary
Founder may not be able to receive tokens even if the founder has one percentage ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail
[ownershipPct]() indicates the ownershipPct The percentage of token ownership of a founder, when an auction is created, a token is [minted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L294).

System will [check if the minted token should be sent to a founder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L238), based on the [tokenRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/storage/TokenStorageV1.sol#L19) mapping.
First, system calculates the `baseTokenId` based on the minted token ID:
```solidity
        uint256 baseTokenId = _tokenId % 100;
```
Then founder address is retrieved from `tokenRecipient`, and token is minted to the founder:
```solidity
            _mint(tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].wallet, _tokenId);
```
The `tokenRecipient` is initialized  in [_addFounders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L120) function:
```solidity
                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);


                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;


                    emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);


                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
Where `baseTokenId` is set to `reservedUntilTokenId` at the beginning:
```solidity
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;
```
And [_getNextTokenId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L186) function finds the next available base token id for a founder:
```solidity
            while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
                _tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
            }


            return _tokenId;
```
It can be seen that `tokenRecipient` stores `_tokenId % 100` as the key, however, if it is the first time entering this function, `baseTokenId` will be returned as it is (without `% 100`), that is, `reservedUntilTokenId` is stored as the key to the founder's address.

If `reservedUntilTokenId` is larger than 100, then when system checks if the minted token should be sent to the founder by  retrieving from `tokenRecipient`, `tokenRecipient[reservedUntilTokenId]` can never be retrieved because `baseTokenId` is always less than 100:
```solidity
uint256 baseTokenId = _tokenId % 100;
```
So the founder is not able to receive any tokens.

## Impact
Founder is not able to receive any tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to return `_tokenId % 100` when it is the first time entering `_getNextTokenId` function.
