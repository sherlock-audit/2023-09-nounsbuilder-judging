# The old founder still receiving NFT even after deleting it from the list

## Summary

The wrong start point for the reverse engineer to delete the reserved tokens for founders

## Vulnerability Detail

If `Token.sol` gets Initialized with only one founder X
With these values `ownershipPct == 10` and `reservedUntilTokenId == 95`
the `Token._addFounders()` will store all these [95 - 5 - 15 - 25 - 35 - 45 - 55 -65 - 75 - 85] base token ID in `tokenRecipient[ ]` for the founder X

Now to Update the list of allocation founders. The owner needs to invoke `Token.updateFounders()`
after the loop is finished it will end up deleting these IDs  [0 - 10 - 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 - 60 - 70 - 80 - 90 ]  from `tokenRecipient[]`
But this is the actual list [95 - 5 - 15 - 25 - 35 - 45 - 55 -65 - 75 - 85]
So you are deleting wrong IDs (in case we have multiple founders) or not existing from the start

```solidity
File: Token.sol

408:                 // using the ownership percentage, get reserved token percentages
409:                 uint256 schedule = 100 / cachedFounder.ownershipPct;
410: 
411:                 // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
412:                 uint256 baseTokenId;
413: 
414:                 for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
415:                     // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
416:                     while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
417:                         baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
418:                     }
419: 
420:                     delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
421:                     clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;
422: 
423:                     emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);
424: 
425:                     // Update the base token id
426:                     baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
427:                 }

```
And that is because It starts with `baseTokenId == 0`
So it needs to start like in `Token._addFounders()` with the value of `reservedUntilTokenId`

## Impact

- The old founder still receiving NFT even after deleting it from the `tokenRecipient[ ]` list
