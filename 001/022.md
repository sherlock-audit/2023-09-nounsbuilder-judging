# Potential Vesting Allocation Issue for First Founder in Token.sol

## Summary
`Token._addFounders` may have a specific issue in the vesting allocation of tokens to the first founder when `reservedUntilTokenId` starts at 100 or higher. This situation could lead to the first founder's initial token allocation being incorrectly mapped/scheduled.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_addFounders` function allocates tokens to founders based on their ownership percentage. If `reservedUntilTokenId` is 100 or higher, the first iteration of the token allocation loop for the first founder will use this value as the `baseTokenId`. 

Given the logic in `_isForFounder` function relies on `_tokenId % 100`, it may not recognize tokens with IDs of 100 or higher as being allocated to founders. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L263-L285

```solidity
    function _isForFounder(uint256 _tokenId) private returns (bool) {
        // Get the base token id
        uint256 baseTokenId = _tokenId % 100;

        // If there is no scheduled recipient:
        if (tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].wallet == address(0)) {
            return false;

            // Else if the founder is still vesting:
        } else if (block.timestamp < tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].vestExpiry) {
            // Mint the token to the founder
            _mint(tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].wallet, _tokenId);

            return true;

            // Else the founder has finished vesting:
        } else {
            // Remove them from future lookups
            delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];

            return false;
        }
    }
```
This mismatch means the first vesting token scheduled for the first founder might not be recognized correctly, affecting the intended distribution.

## Impact
This issue specifically impacts the initial token distribution for the first founder. While subsequent allocations for the same and other founders might not be affected due to the `% 100` operation bringing the `baseTokenId` back into the 0-99 range, the initial allocation for the first founder is at risk of being misallocated. The severity of this issue is medium, as it disrupts the scheduled token distribution mechanism but only under specific circumstances and for a limited subset of tokens.

## Code Snippet
Assuming:
founderPct = 3
reservedUntilTokenId = 125
schedule = 100 / 3 = 33.3 = 33

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L157-L175

```solidity
                // Compute the vesting schedule
                uint256 schedule = 100 / founderPct;

                // Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;

                // For each token to vest:
                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);

                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;

                    emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
The first founder, founder[0] when entering the for loop to invoke _getNextTokenId(125) is going to assign baseTokenId with 125 because the while loop is skipped due to `tokenRecipient[125].wallet == address(0)`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L186-L194

```solidity
    function _getNextTokenId(uint256 _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        unchecked {
            while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
                _tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
            }

            return _tokenId;
        }
    }
```
Nevertheless, all subsequent iterations are going to be guarded by `baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100` and `(++_tokenId) % 100` to ensure `baseTokenId` always assigned 0-99. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the code refactoring below, the `++_tokenId % 100 operation` inside the loop ensures that `_tokenId` wraps around within the 0-99 range even if `reservedUntilTokenId` starts at 100 or higher. This is crucial as it aligns the `_getNextTokenId` function's output with the expectations of the rest of the contract, particularly the `_isForFounder` function.

```diff
    function _getNextTokenId(uint256 _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        unchecked {
-            while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
+            do {
                _tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
-            }
+            } while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0))
            return _tokenId;
        }
    }
