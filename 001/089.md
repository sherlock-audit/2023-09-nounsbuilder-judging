# founders vesting allocation doesn't get updated after reservedUntilTokenId gets updated

## Summary
function `_addFounders()` use the value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` to calculate and set the values for founders vesting allocation, and those vesting are get removed in `updateFounders()` which should be based on the `reservedUntilTokenId` value too. the issue is that when the value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` is updated, the founders vesting allocation should be calculated again and in current implementation vesting allocation stay based on the old value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` which will cause two issue:
1. wrong vesting allocation based on old data.
2. problem when removing vesting allocation in the `updateFounders()` based on new value of `reservedUntilTokenId` while allocation is based on old value of `reservedUntilTokenId`.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is part of the `_addFounders()` code, as you can see it uses the value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` to calculate vesting allocations for founders.
```javascript
                // Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;

                // For each token to vest:
                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);

                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;

                    emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```
This is `updateFounders()` code, the vesting allocations which are saved in the `tokenRecipient[]` mappings are removed when updating founders. so when removing the vesting allocations, code should use the value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` again to calculate vesting allocations an remove them. (currently there is another bug that `baseTokenId` doesn't start with `reservedUntilTokenId`, but to correctly remove the vesting allocations in the `tokenRecipient[]` map, code should do exactly like `_addFounders()` but instead of setting those slots it should delete those slots)
```javascript
                // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
                uint256 baseTokenId;

                for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
                    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
                        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
                    }

                    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
                    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

                    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
```

This is `setReservedUntilTokenId()` code, as you can see code doesn't update vesting allocations for founders.
```javascript
    function setReservedUntilTokenId(uint256 newReservedUntilTokenId) external onlyOwner {
        if (settings.mintCount > 0) {
            revert CANNOT_CHANGE_RESERVE();
        }
        if (settings.totalSupply > 0 && reservedUntilTokenId > newReservedUntilTokenId) {
            revert CANNOT_DECREASE_RESERVE();
        }
        reservedUntilTokenId = newReservedUntilTokenId;
        emit ReservedUntilTokenIDUpdated(newReservedUntilTokenId);
    }
```

so the POC for the issue is:
1. DAO founders deploy the new DAO with `reservedUntilTokenId` as RUT1.
2. code would set founders vesting allocations based on the RUT1.
3. after a while DAO would change the value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` and merkle root for reserved tokens. the new value would be RUT2.
4. right now the vesting allocations are based on RUT1 but the value of the `reservedUntilTokenId` is RUT2 and the vesting allocations are wrong.
5. if DAO wants to update the founders list then the logic that removes the vesting allocation would delete wrong slots in `tokenAllocation[]` mapping because it would calculate those slots based on the RUT2 (if the other bug get fixed) but vesting allocation is still based RUT1.

## Impact
wrong vesting allocation after `reservedUntilTokenId` changes that is based on old value.
wrong vesting allocation causing NFT loss if `updateFounders()` is get called too which creates messy vesting allocation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
either update the vesting allocation when `reservedUntilTokenId` changes or make logic of vesting allocation independent of the `reservedUntilTokenId`.
