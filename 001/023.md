# Mismatch in Founder Vesting Token Allocation and Clearing in Token.sol

## Summary
Token.sol contains a significant logic discrepancy in the handling of founder vesting token allocations between the `_addFounders` and `updateFounders` functions. This mismatch potentially affects the integrity of vesting schedules and the rightful vesting allocation of tokens to founders.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_addFounders`, tokens are allocated for vesting to founders based on a starting token ID (`reservedUntilTokenId`) and a schedule calculated as `100 / founderPct`. However, the `updateFounders` function, which is supposed to clear these allocations, incorrectly assumes a sequential allocation starting from token ID 0. This results in a mismatch, as it fails to clear some or all of the tokens actually allocated to founders in `_addFounders`.

1. **_addFounders Function**:
- reservedUntilTokenId = 75
- founderPct = 2 (for the first founder)
- schedule = 100 / founderPct = 50
- Based on this setup, `tokenRecipient[75]` and `tokenRecipient[25]` are mapped to the first founder (founder[0]). This is because the function calculates the token IDs for vesting based on the `reservedUntilTokenId` and schedules them at intervals determined by schedule.

```solidity
                // Compute the vesting schedule
                uint256 schedule = 100 / founderPct;

                // Used to store the base token id the founder will recieve
                uint256 baseTokenId = reservedUntilTokenId;

                // For each token to vest:
                for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the available token id
                    baseTokenId = _getNextTokenId(baseTokenId);

                    // Store the founder as the recipient
                    tokenRecipient[baseTokenId] = newFounder;

                    emit MintScheduled(baseTokenId, founderId, newFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
            }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L184-L194

```solidity
    /// @dev Finds the next available base token id for a founder
    /// @param _tokenId The ERC-721 token id
    function _getNextTokenId(uint256 _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        unchecked {
            while (tokenRecipient[_tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
                _tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100;
            }

            return _tokenId;
        }
    }
```

2. **updateFounders Function**:
- This function is meant to update founder allocations. However, when it clears the `tokenRecipient` mappings for the previous founders, it appears to do so in a pattern that might not match the actual allocations created in `_addFounders`.
- It assumes a sequential allocation starting from `baseTokenId = 0` and incrementing by `schedule`, which in the case of the first founder would be 0 and 50.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L408-L428

```solidity
                // using the ownership percentage, get reserved token percentages
                uint256 schedule = 100 / cachedFounder.ownershipPct;

                // Used to reverse engineer the indices the founder has reserved tokens in.
                uint256 baseTokenId;

                for (uint256 j; j < cachedFounder.ownershipPct; ++j) {
                    // Get the next index that hasn't already been cleared
                    while (clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] != false) {
                        baseTokenId = (++baseTokenId) % 100;
                    }

                    delete tokenRecipient[baseTokenId];
                    clearedTokenIds[baseTokenId] = true;

                    emit MintUnscheduled(baseTokenId, i, cachedFounder);

                    // Update the base token id
                    baseTokenId = (baseTokenId + schedule) % 100;
                }
            }
```
- However, as per the `_addFounders` logic, the actual allocation for the first founder starts from `reservedUntilTokenId = 75` and then `25`, following the same schedule of `50`.
- This mismatch means `updateFounders` might not correctly clear the old allocations (where it misses clearing tokenRecipient[75] and tokenRecipient[25] for founder[0]).
- Consequently, when `_addFounders()` is re-invoked, `tokenRecipient[75].wallet != address(0)` is going to execute `_tokenId = (++_tokenId) % 100` in `_getNextTokenId()` where founder[0] would end up having baseTokenId's 75, 25, 76, and 26 vesting allocations mapped/scheduled.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is high. It can result in founders retaining vesting rights to tokens they should no longer be entitled to after the `updateFounders` function is executed. This could lead to unfair distributions and potential disputes among founders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor the `updateFounders` function to a more efficient implementation involving a single iteration over the range of 0-99 for token IDs. This approach significantly reduces computational redundancy and optimizes gas usage while ensuring all wallet assigned `tokenRecipient[baseTokenId]` is deleted /cleared:

```solidity
function updateFounders(IManager.FounderParams[] calldata newFounders) external onlyOwner {
    // Clear the existing founders
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < settings.numFounders; i++) {
        delete founder[i];
    }

    // Single iteration over the token IDs
    for (uint256 tokenId = 0; tokenId < 100; tokenId++) {
        if (tokenRecipient[tokenId].wallet != address(0)) {
            delete tokenRecipient[tokenId];
        }
    }

    // Reset and update founders with the new data
    // ... rest of the logic to add new founders ...
}
```
