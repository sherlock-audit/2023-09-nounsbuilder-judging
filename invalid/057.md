# function getAddresses() in manager contract return value for invalid DAO tokens and 0x0 address

## Summary
Function getAddresses() in Manager contract is supposed to DAO contracts addresses for a valid DAO NFT token, but this function return values for 0x0 address or nonexisting DAO tokens too. because this function is used in other logics this behavior will allow attacker to specify 0x0 address as valid DAO NFT token and bypass other logics checks while providing wrong DAO token.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `getAddresses()` code:
```javascript
/// @notice A DAO's contract addresses from its token
    /// @param _token The ERC-721 token address
    /// @return metadata Metadata deployed address
    /// @return auction Auction deployed address
    /// @return treasury Treasury deployed address
    /// @return governor Governor deployed address
    function getAddresses(address _token)
        public
        view
        returns (
            address metadata,
            address auction,
            address treasury,
            address governor
        )
    {
        DAOAddresses storage addresses = daoAddressesByToken[_token];

        metadata = addresses.metadata;
        auction = addresses.auction;
        treasury = addresses.treasury;
        governor = addresses.governor;
    }
```
as you can see there is no check that `_token is a valid DAO NFT token and function will return values even for invalid DAO tokens.
because this function is used as a source of truth by other functions and it's gonna be used by other contracts that are working with DAO and Manager so it's important for contract to return correct values.

This is `getDAOVersions()` function in Manager contract:
```javascript
function getDAOVersions(address token) external view returns (DAOVersionInfo memory) {
        (address metadata, address auction, address treasury, address governor) = getAddresses(token);
        return
            DAOVersionInfo({
                token: _safeGetVersion(token),
                metadata: _safeGetVersion(metadata),
                auction: _safeGetVersion(auction),
                treasury: _safeGetVersion(treasury),
                governor: _safeGetVersion(governor)
            });
    }
```
as you can see it uses `getAddresses(token)` and the issue will happen in this function too and for any invalid token address this function would return valid version numbers instead of reverting.

This is POC for this issue:
1. project A allows users staking tokens for each DAOs created by Nouns builder and it would call `getAddresses()` to get DAO contracts and validate DAO.
2. users calling project A with invalid DAOs would lose their funds as `getAddresses()` return for invalid tokens too.

## Impact
because of lack of validation in `getAddrsses()` and being a source of truth for DAO check, it would be possible to bypass other logics checks that uses `getAddresses()` function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
in `getAddresses()` check the mapping is set before and the values are not 0x0.
