# Suboptimal Validation in `_addFounders` Prevents Max Founder Allocation

## Summary
The `_addFounders` function has a check that restricts the total founder ownership percentage to less than 100%. This prevents the founders from receiving the maximum possible allocation.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `_addFounders` function, there is a check that restricts the total founder ownership from exceeding 99%:
```solidity
// Check that founders own less than 100% of tokens 
if (totalOwnership > 99) {
  revert INVALID_FOUNDER_OWNERSHIP();
}
```
The code comment says the check is to validate "less than 100% ownership". This implies 100% should be allowed.
By using a `>99` comparison instead of  `>100`, the contract does not allow a `100%` total founder allocation. This means at most `99%` of tokens can be allocated to founders.

## Impact
Founders will not receive ~1% of token ownership that were likely intended to be allocated to them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `>99` comparison to `>100` to permit 100% founder ownership scenario.
```solidity
// Check that founders own less than 100% of tokens 
if (totalOwnership > 100) {
  revert INVALID_FOUNDER_OWNERSHIP();
}
```
