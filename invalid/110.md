# The tokenURI() and stakingInfo() methods does not check if the NFT has been minted

## Summary
By invoking the `Token.tokenURI()` method for a maliciously provided NFT id, the returned data may deceive potential users, as the method will return data for a non-existent NFT id that appears to be genuine.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [Token.tokenURI()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L318-L320) methods lack any requirements stating that the provided NFT id must be created.

```solidity
    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view override(IToken, ERC721) returns (string memory) {
        return settings.metadataRenderer.tokenURI(_tokenId);
    }

```
We can also see that in the standard implementation by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/cf86fd9962701396457e50ab0d6cc78aa29a5ebc/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L94), this check is present:
[Throws if _tokenId is not a valid NFT](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
This issue is similar to the one reported in https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar-findings/issues/44.

## Impact
By invoking the `Token.tokenURI()` method for a maliciously provided NFT id, the returned data may deceive potential users, as the method will return data for a non-existent NFT id that appears to be genuine. This can lead to a poor user experience or financial loss for users.
Violation of the ERC721-Metadata part standard.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Throw an error if the NFT id is invalid.
