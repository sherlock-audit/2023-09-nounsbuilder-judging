# Loss of Referral Integrity in Auction.sol When Legitimate `currentBidReferral` is Nullified in `createBid()`

## Summary
This report highlights a significant issue in Auction.sol concerning the `createBidWithReferral` and `createBid` functions. The current implementation allows for the loss of referral information when a bidder who initially bids with a referral later makes a bid without one.

## Vulnerability Detail
The smart contract includes two functions, `createBidWithReferral` and `createBid`, for placing bids on tokens. The former records a referral upon bid placement, while the latter does not. The issue arises when the same bidder initially uses `createBidWithReferral` (thus setting a referral) and subsequently uses `createBid` for the same token. In this scenario, the originally set referral information gets overwritten and lost as `createBid` sets the `currentBidReferral` to `address(0)`.

## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is:

1. **Loss of Referral Tracking**: The initial referrer loses the potential benefit or recognition they should receive, discouraging the use of the referral system.
2. **Potential Revenue Loss for Referrers**: Referrers who bring bidders to the platform may not receive their due rewards if subsequent bids by their referrals do not use `createBidWithReferral`.
3. **Distorted Incentive Structure**: The integrity of the incentive structure for promoting the platform is compromised, potentially affecting user engagement and platform growth. (Note: The same shall apply when bidder has self-incentivized by assigning own self to `currentBidReferral` but accidentally makes a mistake by calling `createBid` in his/her final winning bid.)

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L142-L154

```solidity
    /// @notice Creates a bid for the current token
    /// @param _tokenId The ERC-721 token id
    function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
        currentBidReferral = _referral;
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }

    /// @notice Creates a bid for the current token
    /// @param _tokenId The ERC-721 token id
    function createBid(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
        currentBidReferral = address(0);
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the following code refactoring, `currentBidReferral` in `createBid`  is set based on the existing referral for that bidder and token. If no referral was ever set, it defaults to address(0).

```diff
+    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => address)) private bidReferrals;

    function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
+        address existingReferral = bidReferrals[_tokenId][msg.sender];
+        require(existingReferral == address(0) || existingReferral == _referral, "Referral cannot be changed");

+        if (existingReferral == address(0)) {
+            bidReferrals[_tokenId][msg.sender] = _referral;
+        }

-        currentBidReferral = _referral;
+        currentBidReferral = bidReferrals[_tokenId][msg.sender];
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }

    function createBid(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
-        currentBidReferral = address(0);
+        currentBidReferral = bidReferrals[_tokenId][msg.sender]; // Could be address(0) if no referral
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }
```
