# [H-01] Rewards that has to be paid to the `founder`, `builder` and the `refferal` can round down to 0

## Summary

Computing the total rewards for a bid can round down to 0 leading to loss of rewards for the DAOs.

## Vulnerability Detail

An auction is settled when `_settleAuction` is called which calculates the rewards for the `founder`, `builder` and the `refferal` and then send the token to the highest bidder. The rewards are calculated by calling the `_computeTotalRewards` method:

```solidity
      function _computeTotalRewards(
        address _currentBidRefferal,
        uint256 _finalBidAmount,
        uint256 _founderRewardBps
    ) internal view returns (RewardSplits memory split) {
        // Get global builder recipient from manager
        address builderRecipient = manager.builderRewardsRecipient();

        // Calculate the total rewards percentage
        uint256 totalBPS = _founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS;l

        // Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }

        // Calulate total rewards
        split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT; //@audit this amount is checked in the `_settleAuction`

        // Check if founder reward is enabled
        bool hasFounderReward = _founderRewardBps > 0 && founderReward.recipient != address(0);

        // Set array size based on if founder reward is enabled
        uint256 arraySize = hasFounderReward ? 3 : 2;

        // Initialize arrays
        split.recipients = new address[](arraySize);
        split.amounts = new uint256[](arraySize);
        split.reasons = new bytes4[](arraySize);

        // Set builder reward
        split.recipients[0] = builderRecipient;
        split.amounts[0] = (_finalBidAmount * builderRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;  //@audit - can round down to 0

        // Set referral reward
        split.recipients[1] = _currentBidRefferal != address(0) ? _currentBidRefferal : builderRecipient;
        split.amounts[1] = (_finalBidAmount * referralRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT; //@audit - can round down to 0

        // Set founder reward if enabled
        if (hasFounderReward) {
            split.recipients[2] = founderReward.recipient;
            split.amounts[2] = (_finalBidAmount * _founderRewardBps) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT; //@audit - can round down to 0
        }
    }
```

As we can see, firstly the `totalRewards` are calculated and then the rewards for each recipient are calculated separately. The problem is that calculating the rewards for each recipient separately can round down to 0. This can happen, for example, if `(_finalBidAmount * referralRewardsBPS) ` is less than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT` which is `10_000:

```solidity
    uint256 private constant BPS_PER_100_PERCENT = 10_000;
```

And this is quite realistic scenario if the `_finalBidAmount` is not that high and if the percentage for the respective receiver is not high.

Then, back in the `_settleAuction` function only the `totalRewards` is checked which can be higher than 0 as it is the sum of all of the recipients divided by `10_000`:

```solidity
                RewardSplits memory split = _computeTotalRewards(currentBidReferral, highestBid, founderReward.percentBps);

                if (split.totalRewards != 0) {
                    // Deposit rewards
                    rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
                }
```



## Impact

Loss of rewards for specific roles inside a DAO/auction.

## Recommendation

Check if the rewards for each specific receiver are `!= 0`.
