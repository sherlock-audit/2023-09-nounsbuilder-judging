# Non compliance with ERC721

## Summary
Interactions with `ERC721` contracts expect that calls to `balanceOf()` and `ownerOf()` functions do not revert, in line with the `ERC721` standard. Deviations from this expectation may be seen as noncompliant with the standard.

## Vulnerability Detail
Contracts relying on these functions may not anticipate reverts and may not handle such cases.

## Impact
This could result in an unwanted reverts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Zero address checks are not needed here and can be removed, since it would return zero or address(0) and that complies with the standard.
It's a best practice not to use the revert statement within functions marked as view to adhere to the intended purpose of these functions and to avoid potential confusion for developers using your contract.
