    function depositToTreasury() external payable {
        (, , , address treasury, ) = _getDAOAddressesFromSender();

        // Transfer ether to treasury
        (bool success, ) = treasury.call{ value: msg.value }("");

        // Revert if transfer fails
        if (!success) {
            revert TRANSFER_FAILED();
        }
    }
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls.
