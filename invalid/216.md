# function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction can be DOSed

## Summary
As there is no validation that  total percentage must not be greater than 100% When  the function  setFounderReward is called, it may create  DOS.  


## Vulnerability Detail
function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction can be DOSed
Let assume builderRewards pct is 80%, referralRewards pct is 5% , founderReward pct is 15%. so the total percentage is 100%. Now the owner canâ€™t increase  as  builderRewards,referralRewards pct is immutable.

If the owner mistakenly/intentionally calls the function  setFounderReward with founderReward pct 20%, then the total percentage will be 105%.

When the function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction is called which leads to call the function _computeTotalRewards which leads to verify that total percentage must not be greater than 100%, but in this situation total percentage is greater  than 100% which will lead to revert the function calling.this will be temporary as founderReward pct can be decreased after knowing the issue.

## Impact
This will lead to  no settlement of the current auction and also no creation of a new auction temporarily(before knowing the issue).
