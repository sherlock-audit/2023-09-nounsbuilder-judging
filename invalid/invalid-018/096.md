# SafeCast should be used when parsing startTime and endTime to uint40

## Summary
The **endTime** is calculated as `endTime = startTime + settings.duration`. Both startTime and setting.duration are uint40. It is possible that endTime exceeds uint40. In the next line it is formatted to uint40 as `uint40(endTime)`. It can lead to unexpected values like endTime < block.timestamp.

## Vulnerability Detail
The safeCast lib should be used to parse numbers as overflow can lead to unexpected values.

## Impact
In a case if auction.endTime < block.timestamp, The auction will be considered ended and the NFT will burn on `settleAuction()` call.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeCast
```diff
-            auction.startTime = uint40(startTime);
-            auction.endTime = uint40(endTime);

+            auction.startTime = SafeCast.toUint40(startTime);
+            auction.endTime = SafeCast.toUint40(endTime);
```
