# Duration set to 0 leads to permanent cycle of token burning until treasury steps in and stops the protocol

## Summary
Inside `Auction.sol`, [Line 127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L127) allows for auction duration to be zero:

```solidity
        // Store the auction house settings
        settings.duration = SafeCast.toUint40(_duration);
```

Once the contract gets unpaused as expected, it will enter into a constant state of token burning and auction restarting, which can only be fixed if the Treasury steps in and pauses the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the contract gets unpaused, it will call `_createAuction` for the first time. When duration is 0, the `endTime` will be the same as `startTime`, as we can see from these [lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L305-L308):

```solidity
            unchecked {
                // Compute the auction end time
                endTime = startTime + settings.duration;
            }
```

Any attempt to create a bid will revert with `AUCTION_OVER`. When somebody calls `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction`, the token will get burned because there's no bidder, and a new auction with duration zero will be created, resuming the same problematic cycle.

## Impact
Duration set to zero will have the impact that no bidding can ever occur. In other words, an allowed input can virtually make the contract unworkable.

Because `setDuration` can only be called when the contract is paused, and the Treasury is the owner of the contract once an auction has started, this means that the Treasury needs to manually intervene by calling `pause` and then `setDuration` to change it.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add two checks that won't allow duration to be zero: one in `initialize` and another in `setDuration`. Example:

```solidity
  function setDuration(uint256 _duration) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        require(_duration != 0, "Auction: duration cannot be zero");
        settings.duration = SafeCast.toUint40(_duration);

        emit DurationUpdated(_duration);
    }
```
