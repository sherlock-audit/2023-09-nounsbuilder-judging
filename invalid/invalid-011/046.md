# Users are still able to bid on an auction after the auction has paused

## Summary

The `Auction` contract allows users to bid on an auction after the auction has paused.

The `Auction` contract allows users to bid on an auction after the auction has paused.

The `createBidWidthREferral` and `createBid` functions do not check whether the auction contract is paused or not. If the auction contract that is set to unpause start to bid on an auction. After that, although an owner of the auction contract pauses the auction contract, users are still able to bid on an auction.

## Impact

The auction contract pause function is not working as expected.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
    currentBidReferral = _referral;
    _createBid(_tokenId);
}

/// @notice Creates a bid for the current token
/// @param _tokenId The ERC-721 token id
function createBid(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
    currentBidReferral = address(0);
    _createBid(_tokenId);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the modifier `whenNotPaused` to the `createBidWithReferral` and `createBid` functions.

```solidity
function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {}

function createBid(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {}
```
