# referral will never get referral reward because `currentBidReferral` will always be resetted to zero-address whenever `createBid()` is used after `createBidWithReferral()`

## Summary
The logic for saving `currentBidReferral` is faulty.
## Vulnerability Detail
[here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/storage/AuctionStorageV2.sol#L8) is the  variable for saving `currentBidReferral`  in `AuctionStorageV2.sol`.

The issue is that a client can call `createBidWithReferral()` to set an address as a referral when placing a bid [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L144-L145) BUT if another client bids via createBid(), `createBidWithReferral()` will be set to address(0) unsetting the address that was set as referral by the previous client that bid via `createBidWithReferral()`. 

This happens even if the previous bidder is the highest bidder.

`builderRecipient` will be set as the recipient of referral reward [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L499-L500) instead of the address of the referral set by previous bidder when placing bid via `createBidWithReferral()` because `currentBidReferral` has been resetted to address(0)
## Impact
referral will never get referral reward because `currentBidReferral` will always be resetted to zero-address whenever `createBid()` is used after `createBidWithReferral()` 
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change the way the current bid referral is saved, maybe use a mapping that uses the tokenId as key.

only update the mapping with `currentBidReferral` when msg.value is greater than `lastHighestBid`.

Then when setting reward recipients via `_computeTotalRewards()`, use the `tokenId` to pull the current bid referral saved
