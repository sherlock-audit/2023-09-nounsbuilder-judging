# Critical Read-only Reentrancy Vulnerability in Token Minting Process

## Summary

Token.sol::_mint function not following CEI pattern, opens the platform to potential read-only reentrancy attack

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of `Token.sol::_mint` function is vulnerable to read-only reentrancy. The implementation does not strictly follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern as it increments the `settings.totalSupply` after sending out the token. This is not an immediate risk to the protocol itself due to the nonReentrant modifier, but this is still vulnerable to read-only reentrancy.

As an example, malicious claimer can use a contract with a callback to call `MerkleReserveMinter.mintFromReserve` with the sufficient Merkle proofs to receive the NFT before the `totalSupply` is updated. The malicious actor can later exploit any integrated 3rd party that rely on the not up-to-date `totalSupply` in their operation.

## Impact

Despite the implementation of nonReentrant protection, an attacker can exploit the readonly reentrancy attack on functions dependent on `totalSupply`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update `totalSupply` before the minting process to adhere to the CEI pattern.
