# The  function tokenURI/contractURI may be DOSed if uri is large enough.

## Summary
The  function tokenURI/contractURI may be DOSed if uri is large enough.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that if the uri length is big enough as a result the function consumes more than the maximum amount of gas. This would cause the transaction to revert.

The dos is only possible on a low cost chain(so not on the ETH mainnet). So let us consider the polygon which has a block gas limit of 30 million gas.  

So the function will revert if it consumes more than 30 million gas.

## Impact
the function may be DOSed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a reasonable limit for the length of the token uri when deploying the contract..
