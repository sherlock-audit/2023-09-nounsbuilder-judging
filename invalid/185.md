# `settleAuction` will cause the Auction contract to not being able to create any new auctions further.

## Summary

`settleAuction` will cause the Auction contract to not being able to create any new auctions further.

## Vulnerability Detail

`settleAuction` will invoke the internal function `_settleAuction` , which will then set `auction.settled` value to `true` . However, the only way to create a new auction is by calling the private function `_createAuction` . The only functions that can invoke `_createAuction` are: `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` and `unpause` . However, if you call the first function, it will revert since the previous auction is already settled. The latter is only available to the owner, so it'll require intervention from the owner everytime this happens (and the owner will need to work around by calling `pause` then `unpause` to resume).

## Impact

`settleAuction` will cause the Auction contract to not being able to create any new auctions further.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Remove `settleAuction` in favor of `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction`
- Add a new function to allow a creation of new auction without requiring to settle the old one, OR modify the logic in `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` so that it doesn't revert when the previous auction has been settled
