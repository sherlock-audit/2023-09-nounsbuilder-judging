# Unrestricted Approval in setApprovalForAll

## Summary
the problem is arise from that the function grants approval without any specific limitations or conditions. The absence of proper checks allows the operator to gain complete control over all tokens owned by the sender.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function takes an operator address  and a boolean value _approved indicating whether permission is being given or removed, It then updates the approval status for the given operator in the operatorApprovals mapping for the sender's address (msg.sender). and the problem arise in the `setApprovalForAll` function, in this line `operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] = _approved; ` in this line  it's allows any address to set approval for all tokens of msg.sender and this can let an attacker to trick msg.sender into calling this function
## Impact
the issue it's allows an attacker to perform unauthorized token transfers on behalf of the victim. This could result in loss of fund
Here is a scenario 
let's say  taht an attacker becoming an approved operator for a victim's address using the setApprovalForAll function. The attacker, without any restrictions, can then transfer any tokens owned by the victim without requiring explicit approval for each transfer.
as an example :
- Attacker calls setApprovalForAll(attackerAddress, true) on behalf of the victim.
- Attacker can now transfer any token owned by the victim without further approval.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
- add a  check to ensure that msg.sender is the owner of the tokens.
