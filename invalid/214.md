# ETH funds(bid) can be stuck in the auction contract.

## Summary
When the function _computeTotalRewards is called, there is a check that totalBPS can’t be greater than 100%. But there is no check that totalBPS can’t be less than 100%.


## Vulnerability Detail
Let assume  builderRewards pct is 70%, referralRewards pct is 5% and founderReward pct is 15%. So the total percentage is 90%.if highestbid is 5 ETH, then the function _computeTotalRewards will calculate 90% rewards i.e 4.5 ETH will be sent to builder,referral,  founder and 10% i.e 0.5 ETH will be stuck in the auction contract.

This can also happen mistakenly, let’s take an example, when an auction contract is deployed, then   builderRewards pct and referralRewards pct are set in the  constructor and they are immutable. Let assume  builderRewards pct is 65%, referralRewards pct is 5% and founderReward pct is 30%.founderReward pct can be changed. So if the owner mistakenly reduces  the founderReward pct, funds will be stuck in the contract.

Let’s take another example,if mistakenly builderRewards pct is set to 55%, referralRewards pct is 5% , founderReward pct is 30%(which can’t be greater than 30%).so total percentage is 90%. Now the owner can’t increase any percentage as  builderRewards,referralRewards pct is immutable and founderReward pct can’t be greater than 30%.



## Impact
ETH funds/bid will be lost.

## Recommendation
Always make sure/ validate that the total reward percentage should not be less than 100%.
