# in Auction contract, the minimum limit for reward rate is 0.0001 which will be inconvenient for some cases

## Summary
DAO founders specify the founders reward rate by setting `founderRewardBps`, the issue is that the reward rate denominator is 10K so it won't be possible to set reward rate less than 0.0001 and this will create issue when the price of the NFT is high like $50K but founders want to keep the founders reward rate to 1$, because of this issue it won't be possible to to this. code should support more general reward rates and minimum limit 0.0001 is to high.
the same issue exists for `referralRewardsBPS` and `builderRewardsBPS` too.

## Vulnerability Detail
to calculate reward rates in Auction contract code uses `rewardRate / 1000`. so the minimum reward rate for `founderRewards`, `referralRewards` and `builderRewards`  would be at least 0.0001 in the protocol. This is inconvenient for some cases that the price of the token is to high like >10K and founders or builder wants to set low reward rate to make rewards near $1.

## Impact
it won't be possible to config the rewards rate to low absolute value for DAO when NFT price is high.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
code should use higher value for denominator to support bigger range for reward rates.
