# The auctions end time can be incorrect

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Every auction has a duration and with that duration the end time is calculated. 
```solidity
unchecked {
                // Compute the auction end time
                endTime = startTime + settings.duration;
            }
```

The setDuration() function allows the owner to modify the duration.

```solidity
/// @notice Updates the time duration of each auction
    /// @param _duration The new time duration
    function setDuration(uint256 _duration) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        settings.duration = SafeCast.toUint40(_duration);

        emit DurationUpdated(_duration);
    }
```

The problem is that when the owner changes the auction's duration, the end time is not updated, leading to incorrect settlement time.

```solidity
// Ensure the auction is over
        if (block.timestamp < _auction.endTime) revert AUCTION_ACTIVE();
```
## Impact
The owner can adjust variables like reservePrice, timeBuffer, minBidIncrement and founderReward during an active auction. However, the auction's end time cannot be changed even if the duration is changed.
## Code Snippet
POC :
Auction.t.sol

```solidity
function test_SettleAuction() public {
        deployMock();

        vm.prank(founder);
        auction.unpause();

        vm.prank(bidder1);
        auction.createBid{ value: 0.420 ether }(2);

        vm.prank(bidder2);
        auction.createBid{ value: 1 ether }(2);

        // Lets say that the auction is created with the wrong duration and
        // the owner paused the auction to change the duration
        vm.prank(address(treasury));
        auction.pause();

        // the owner sets the correct duration
        vm.prank(address(treasury));
        auction.setDuration(100 minutes);

        assertEq(auction.duration(), 100 minutes);

        //unpauses the auction
        vm.prank(address(treasury));
        auction.unpause();

        // Even if the owner changes the duration, the end time doesn't change and the auction can still be settled
        vm.warp(10 minutes + 1 seconds);
        auction.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the owner modifies the duration parameter, update the end time of the auctions accordingly.
