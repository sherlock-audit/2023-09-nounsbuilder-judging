# Auction contract could be paused maliciously !

## Summary
Auction contract could be paused maliciously ! 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a function ` _createAuction`  in Auction contract. 
There is a function _createAuction in Auction contract.

It consists of the following logic:

```solidity 

function _createAuction() private {
    try token.mint() returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        **creating of the auction for token with id equal to tokenId**
        // Pause the contract if token minting failed
    } catch Error(string memory) {
        _pause();
    }
}

```

According to the [EIP-150](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md) call opcode can consume as most 63/64 of parrent calls’ gas. That means `  token.mint() ` can fail since there will be no gas.

All in all, if `  token.mint() ` fail on gas and the rest gas is enough for pausing the contract by calling _pause in catch statement the contract will be paused.

Please note, that a bug can be exploitable if the `  token.mint() `  consume more than 1.500.000 of gas, because 1.500.000 / 64 > 20.000 that need to pause the contract. Also, the logic of `  token.mint() ` includes traversing the array up to 100 times, that’s heavy enough to reach 1.500.000 gas limit.
## Impact
Contract can be paused by any user by passing special amount of gas for the call of `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction `(which consists of two internal calls of `_settleAuction `and `_createAuction `functions).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a special check for upper bound of `gasLeft `at start of `_createAuction `function.
