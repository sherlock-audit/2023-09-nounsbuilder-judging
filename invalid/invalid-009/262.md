# Arbitralilty Pausing in Auction

## Summary
The contract can be pause by any one by passing the gas limit when call the `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` function.


## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can pause the contract if there is enough gas left over after the `token.mint()` function reverts, triggering the `pause()` function. This vulnerability exists in the Auction contract, where the `_createAuction()` function can be invoked by anyone through the `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` function.

On line 294, the `token.mint()` function may run out of gas, in accordance with (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md, and can consume a high amount of gas due to iteration through the array in the function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L232-L238

Since there is insufficient gas for an external call, the subsequent `try / catch` block will lead to the contract being paused if there is enough remaining gas.


## Impact
Anyone can pause the contract if there is enough gas left over for the `pause()` function after the `mint()` function reverts.

## Tool used

Visual code / Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `try / catch` and let the function revert instead of pausing the contract.
