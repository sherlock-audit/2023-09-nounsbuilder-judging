# Malicious pausing auction attack

## Summary

The third party can control the gas and cause the external call of the contract to fail, but the remaining 1 / 64 gas can still execute the subsequent logic try/catch normally, causing problems in the pause logic.

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue involves the fix from the previous review, refer to: [M-12](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-12-try-catch-block-at-auction_createauction-will-only-catch-string-errors)„ÄÅ[M-15](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-15-malicious-pausing-the-contract).
The main problem has been detailed in M-15, but due to intentional design, the previous contract would not catch OOG errors, but the fix in M-12 will now catch OOG errors.
Therefore, a malicious attacker can use a carefully designed gas amount to maliciously suspend the contract operation.

## Impact

The contract was maliciously suspended and had to wait for the owner to unpause and mint coins.
