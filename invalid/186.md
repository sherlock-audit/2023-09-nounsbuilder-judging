# L2MigrationDeployer doesn't enforce its address to be the founder[0]

## Summary
The comment in [line 86 of the L2MigrationDeployer contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/deployers/L2MigrationDeployer.sol#L86) says that "The address of this deployer must be set as founder 0". The documentation provided by the project also entails this:

> The caller must set the L2MigrationDeployer.sol contract as the first founder (with 0 allocation) so it can manage setup.

However, the `deploy` function doesn't enforce the `founder 0` to be the `L2MigrationDeployer` address, and failing to do so invalidates the usage of other contract functions such as `renounceOwnership`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `deploy` function passes all inputs to `Manager.deploy` function without doing checks on such inputs:

```solidity
    function deploy(
        IManager.FounderParams[] calldata _founderParams,
        IManager.TokenParams calldata _tokenParams,
        IManager.AuctionParams calldata _auctionParams,
        IManager.GovParams calldata _govParams,
        MerkleReserveMinter.MerkleMinterSettings calldata _minterParams
    ) external returns (address token) {
        if (_getTokenFromSender() != address(0)) {
            revert DAO_ALREADY_DEPLOYED();
        }

        // Deploy the DAO
        (address _token, , , , ) = IManager(manager).deploy(_founderParams, _tokenParams, _auctionParams, _govParams);
```

Noteworthy, it doesn't check that `founder 0` is actually `address(this)`. This means that sensitive functions such as `renounceOwnership` will not be callable, since `L2MigrationDeployer` will not be the owner of `token` and `auction`.

## Impact
Function `renounceOwnership` will not be callable, since `L2MigrationDeployer` will not be the owner of `token` and `auction`.

## Recommendation
Add an additional check in the `deploy` function:

```solidity
require(_founderParams[0].wallet == address(this), "L2MigrationDeployer: Founder must be the deployer contract");
```
