# `MerkleReserveMinter` wouldn't work with a higher price than 18.5 ETH

## Summary
`MerkleReserveMinter` wouldn't work with a higher price than 18.5 ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MerkleMinterSettings.pricePerToken` is declared as `uint64`.

```solidity
    struct MerkleMinterSettings {
        /// @notice Unix timestamp for the mint start
        uint64 mintStart;
        /// @notice Unix timestamp for the mint end
        uint64 mintEnd;
        /// @notice Price per token
        uint64 pricePerToken; //@audit around 18 ETH
        /// @notice Merkle root for
        bytes32 merkleRoot;
    }
```

So `pricePerToken` will be at most `2^64 = 18.446e18` and `MerkleReserveMinter` wouldn't work if a token price is higher than 18.5 ETH.

## Impact
`MerkleReserveMinter` wouldn't work with a higher price than 18.5 ETH.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It would be better to declare `pricePerToken` as `uint128`.
