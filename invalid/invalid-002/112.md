# hardcoded gas limit could result in failed transactions

## Summary
There are many instances of hardcoded gas limit `_handleOutgoingTransfer` function that depending on the complexity of the transaction or gas cost changes in Ethereum could result in failed transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:
 Hard coded gasLimit or gasPrice that can result in failure of transaction.

##auction/Auction.sol#L524C9-L528C10
```solidity
assembly {
            // Transfer ETH to the recipient
            // Limit the call to 50,000 gas
            success := call(50000, _to, _amount, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        }

```

## Impact
Transaction might get revert due to hardcoded gas limit.

## Recommendation
Use web3 gas estimate instead. To be sure, there can be an additional gas added to the estimated value or ```max(HARDCODED_GAS, estimated_amount)```
