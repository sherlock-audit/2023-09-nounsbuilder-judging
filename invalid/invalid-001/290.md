# Auction implementation can be upgraded during ongoing auction

## Summary
The implementation of the `Auction` contract can be upgraded even if the current auction is still ongoing. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function of the `Auction` contract is guarded with the `whenPaused` modifier. But the current auction should be also considered as ongoing while it has not received `settled` status.

## Impact
The `Auction` implementation upgrading during the ongoing auction can cause unexpected behavior and the highest bidder assets losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking if the current auction has already settled before the `Auction` contract upgrading.
