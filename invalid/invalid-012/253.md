# Use `safeTransferFrom` in `Auction._settleAuction`

## Summary
Use `safeTransferFrom` in `Auction._settleAuction`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_settleAuction` calls `transferFrom` and it may cause ERC721 to be locked in a receiver contract which do not have `onERC721Received` function.
`token.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.highestBidder, _auction.tokenId);`

## Impact
Same as Vulnerability Detail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `transferFrom` with `safeTransferFrom`.
ERC721.safeTransferFrom is sometimes avoided because of reentrancy attacks.
It is, however, safe because the functions calling `_settleAuction` is nonReentrant.
- `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction`
- `settleAuction`
