# The usage of transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() may leaad to token loss if the highest bidder is a contract which can't receive ERC721 tokens.

## Summary

In Auction.sol in the _settleAuction function, the usage of transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom to transfer the ERC721 token to the highest bidder may result in the token being lost if the highest bidder (receiver) is a contract that can't accept ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Auction.sol file, function _settleAuction(), line 280 - transferFrom() was used to transfer the ERC721 token to the highest bidder in order to settle the auction, instead of safeTransferFrom(). The usage of transferFrom() can lead to the ERC721 token being stuck if the auction participant is/was a contract which isn't ERC721 compliant (i.e. hasn't implemented the ERC721 standard as part of their contract). This will lead to the particular ERC721 token being inaccessible, which can present a monetary loss for the user which bid for the token. 

It is arguable that using safeTransferFrom() adds an external call to the action which may open an attack surface for a reentrancy attack, in this case this is negligible due to the fact that a nonReentrant modifier is used on all public/external functions. 

## Impact

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L280

`token.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.highestBidder, _auction.tokenId);`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom(). Since safeTransferFrom() checks if the highest bidder has implemented an  IERC721Receiver which can prevent the possible loss of the ERC721 token if the bidder is a contract.
