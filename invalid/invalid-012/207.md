# Use of transferFrom may lead to NFTs getting locked forever

## Summary

It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721s.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `transferFrom()` method is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()` in the contract ` Auction.sol` , which I assume is a gas-saving measure because `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` and `settleAuction()` already uses nonReentrant modifier. 

[OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of transferFrom(); use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible
The recipient could have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom().

## Impact

Use of transferFrom may lead to NFTs getting locked forever and can cause unwanted issues for users.

## Code Snippet

[`Auction.sol#L280`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L280C4-L280C4)

## Recommendation

Evaluate using ERC721 `safeTransferFrom()` to avoid NFTs getting stuck.
