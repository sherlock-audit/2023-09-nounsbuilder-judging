# Use `safeTransferFrom(...)` to send NFT to the bidder instead of `transferFrom(...)`

## Summary
`Auction.sol::_settleAuction(...)` doesn't check if the bidder is capable of receiving the NFT as it could be both `EOA` as well as a `Contract`(according to logic). So there are chances that the NFT might be permanently lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Auction::_settleAuction(...)` is used to settle the auction after it's completion. To create a bid in the auction, bidder calls `Auction::_createBid(...)` function. But this function does not have any check whether the bidder is an `EOA` or a `Contract`. So there are chances that someone might create a bid with a contract and ends up being the highest bidder. In that case the `Auction::_settleAuction(...)` will send the NFT to that contract. Here is a line of code that does the NFT transfer:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L280

To do the transfer, `token.transferFrom(...)` is used. But this doesn't check if the contract is capable of receiving the NFT as you can see in the `ERC721.sol` that is inherited by `Token.sol`(indirectly):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/token/ERC721.sol#L125-L152

Doing this for an `EOA` is completely fine, but not for a contract. Because In order to check the capability of the contract to receive the NFT, it is a common practice that the receiver contract inherits a standard `ERC721Receiver.sol`(or something like that) contract that contains a special function that the `ERC721.sol` can call during the transfer of the NFT to check it's capability. But `transferFrom(...)` doesn't have checks for that. This is a very bad practice and is also discouraged by Openzeppelin(read more [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)).

Now doing this might not cause any harm for the protocol, but the receiver might lost his NFT permanently. Also there are chances that some NFT Marketplaces doesn't recognize the NFT as well. So instead of using `token.transferFrom(...)`, use `token.safeTransferFrom(...)` that has the check for this type of cases.

## Impact
A receiver might loose his NFT. Although it might not affect the protocol, it does give bad user experience

## Tool used

- Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use `safeTransferFrom(...)` instead to transfer the NFT to bidder. But it should be kept in mind that this function makes an external call to the receiver contract to check the it's capability that might cause reentrancy attacks. So proper checks should be implemented in the functions that are using this. 

```diff
    function _settleAuction() private {
        // Get a copy of the current auction
        Auction memory _auction = auction;


        // Ensure the auction wasn't already settled
        if (auction.settled) revert AUCTION_SETTLED();


        // Ensure the auction had started
        if (_auction.startTime == 0) revert AUCTION_NOT_STARTED();


        // Ensure the auction is over
        if (block.timestamp < _auction.endTime) revert AUCTION_ACTIVE();


        // Mark the auction as settled
        auction.settled = true;


        // If a bid was placed:
        if (_auction.highestBidder != address(0)) {
            // Cache the amount of the highest bid
            uint256 highestBid = _auction.highestBid;


            // If the highest bid included ETH: Pay rewards and transfer remaining amount to the DAO treasury
            if (highestBid != 0) {
                // Calculate rewards
                RewardSplits memory split = _computeTotalRewards(currentBidReferral, highestBid, founderReward.percentBps);


                if (split.totalRewards != 0) {
                    // Deposit rewards
                    rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
                }


                // Deposit remaining amount to treasury
                _handleOutgoingTransfer(settings.treasury, highestBid - split.totalRewards);
            }


            // Transfer the token to the highest bidder
-            token.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.highestBidder, _auction.tokenId);
+           token.safeTransferFrom(address(this), _auction.highestBidder, _auction.tokenId);

            // Else no bid was placed:
        } else {
            // Burn the token
            token.burn(_auction.tokenId);
        }


        emit AuctionSettled(_auction.tokenId, _auction.highestBidder, _auction.highestBid);
    }
```

>NOTE
> If the receiver contract that doesn't contains the required function by `safeTransferFrom(...)`, then the settlement will not happen as it will always revert. And it might make the whole protocol unusable. So for these types of cases, give the bidder capability to change the address for receiving NFT.
