# DoS of the current auction settlement due to bad location of check

## Summary
The `_settleAuction` function can be blocked because of the max rewards sum check at the `_computeTotalRewards` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Auction._computeTotalRewards` function checks the `totalBPS` value and reverts in case it is not less than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`.
```solidity
        // Calculate the total rewards percentage
        uint256 totalBPS = _founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS;

        // Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }
```
There are no checks if the `_founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS` sum exceeds `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT` when setting the values. So it can happen.  
Though it is possible to change the founder reward in current implementation of the contract even the auction ongoing, but it will help only if the sum of `referralRewardsBPS` and `builderRewardsBPS` is less than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`. In any case it takes time to change auction parameters and interrupts the auction working.

## Impact
Temporary DoS of the `_settleAuction` function. The highest bidder can't receive the token immediately to participate at the voting or to delegate votes. The DoS will be permanent in case the sum of the `referralRewardsBPS` and `builderRewardsBPS` immutables exceeds `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the max sum of the `referralRewardsBPS` and `builderRewardsBPS` immutables at the `constructor` and the `totalBPS` max value at the `setFounderReward` function.
