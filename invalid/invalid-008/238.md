# Use `safeTransferFrom(`) instead of `transferFrom(`) for outgoing erc721 transfers

## Summary
It is recommended to use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()` when transferring ERC721 token to the `highestBidder`

## Vulnerability Details
The `transferFrom()` method is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()`, which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because: 
[OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()`; use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible
The recipient could have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`. A notable example of such contracts is the Sudoswap pair:
```solidity
function onERC721Received(
  address,
  address,
  uint256 id,
  bytes memory
) public virtual returns (bytes4) {
  IERC721 _nft = nft();
  // If it's from the pair's NFT, add the ID to ID set
  if (msg.sender == address(_nft)) {
    idSet.add(id);
  }
  return this.onERC721Received.selector;
}
```
It helps ensure that the recipient is indeed capable of handling ERC721s.

## Impact
There is the potential loss of NFTs should the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721s.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransferFrom()` when sending the ERC721 token to the highest bidder
```diff
- IERC721(_erc721Address).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _id);
+ IERC721(_erc721Address).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _id);
```
