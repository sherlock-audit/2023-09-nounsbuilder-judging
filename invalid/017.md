# `lastHighestBidder` will always be refunded even though he's still the highest bidder.

## Summary
this is due to a missing check 
## Vulnerability Detail
There should be a check in `Auction._createBid()` before the call to  `_handleOutgoingTransfer()` to ascertain if `lastHighestBidder` is still the highest bidder or not before refunding him his bid.

The issue is the `lastHighestBidder` will always be refunded even though he's still the highest bidder.

## Impact
`lastHighestBidder` will always be refunded even though he's still the highest bidder.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
place a check directly above the call to `_handleOutgoingTransfer()` in   `Auction._createBid()` to ensure the `lastHighestBidder` is no more the highest bidder before refunding him his bid.

Maybe use a bool `isStillHighestBidder`
