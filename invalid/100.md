# Users can receive free tokens if owners intended for an open price auction

## Summary

If owners intended for the users to choose the price of NFT tokens, users may receive tokens for free. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Owners are able to set the reserve token price which dictates the initial price when auctioning off tokens through the `setReservePrice()` which allows the owner to set reserve prices to zero even though they would be able to freely mint tokens via the `mint()` function for giveaways to the community.

```solidity
/// @notice Updates the reserve price of each auction
/// @param _reservePrice The new reserve price
function setReservePrice(uint256 _reservePrice) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
    settings.reservePrice = _reservePrice;

    emit ReservePriceUpdated(_reservePrice);
}
```

In the `_settleAuction()` function when there is no bidder address zero is handled accordingly by burning tokens  then moving on to the next auction however, the contract does not handle all other cases where `highestBid != 0`.

```solidity
// If a bid was placed:
if (_auction.highestBidder != address(0)) {
    // Cache the amount of the highest bid
    uint256 highestBid = _auction.highestBid;

    // If the highest bid included ETH: Pay rewards and transfer remaining amount to the DAO treasury
    if (highestBid != 0) {
        // Calculate rewards
        RewardSplits memory split = _computeTotalRewards(currentBidReferral, highestBid, founderReward.percentBps); 

        if (split.totalRewards != 0) {
            // Deposit rewards
            rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
        }

        // Deposit remaining amount to treasury
        _handleOutgoingTransfer(settings.treasury, highestBid - split.totalRewards);
    }

    // @audit-issue - users may get free tokens if the owners intended for an open offering where the community determine the price of tokens.
    // Transfer the token to the highest bidder
    token.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.highestBidder, _auction.tokenId); 

    // Else no bid was placed:
} else {
    // Burn the token
    token.burn(_auction.tokenId);
}
```

## Impact

This was rated a medium in severity because certain edge cases must be satisfied for users to receive free DAO tokens where owners intended for the community to determine the prices of these tokens. The following proof of concept outlines this scenario:

```solidity
function testOpenAuctionPrices() public {
    deployMock();

    vm.startPrank(founder);
    auction.setMinimumBidIncrement(10);
    // open auction prices where the community determines the price of tokens
    auction.setReservePrice(0); 
    auction.unpause();
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(bidder1.balance, 100 ether);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(bidder1), 0);

    vm.prank(bidder1);
    auction.createBid{ value: 0 ether }(2);

    (
        uint256 tokenId, 
        uint256 highestBid, 
        address highestBidder, 
        uint40 startTime, 
        uint40 endTime, 
        bool settled
    ) = auction.auction();
    vm.warp(endTime);
    vm.startPrank(address(bidder1));
    auction.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction();
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(bidder1.balance, 100 ether);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(bidder1), 1);
}
```

## Recommendation

I recommend handling highest bids which are zero in one of two ways:
- Handle zero in highest bids similarly to how the last bidder is address zero, by burning the token.
- Disallowing owners to set the reserve price to zero.
