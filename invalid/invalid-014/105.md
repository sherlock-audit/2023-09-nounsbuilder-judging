# Overflow may cause the auction to get stuck

## Summary
The _computeTotalRewards function will be run at checkout to do the calculations. But here it may overflow due to incorrect initialisation of referralRewardsBPS and builderRewardsBPS values. Thus the auction cannot be settled and the next auction cannot be started.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the following code restrictions, totalBPS cannot exceed 10000 and _founderRewardBps will not exceed 3000. but there is no restriction for referralRewardsBPS and builderRewardsBPS, which may make totalBPS exceed 10000 and thus cause an error. This can cause the auction to never settle successfully and thus get stuck. Although it is unlikely to happen, it has a fatal effect on all DAOs.

## Impact
May cause the auction to be stuck.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _computeTotalRewards(
        address _currentBidRefferal,
        uint256 _finalBidAmount,
        uint256 _founderRewardBps
    ) internal view returns (RewardSplits memory split) {
        // Get global builder recipient from manager
        address builderRecipient = manager.builderRewardsRecipient();

        // Calculate the total rewards percentage
        uint256 totalBPS = _founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS; //@audit 

        // Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is proposed to give certain limits to referralRewardsBPS and builderRewardsBPS.
