# `Auction.setMinimumBidIncrement` might affect the ongoing auction

## Summary
While calling `Auction.setMinimumBidIncrement`, the only requirement is that Auction is paused, but when Auction.sol is paused, there might be a ongoing auction, in such case, the `settings.minBidIncrement` will be different between before and after `Auction.setMinimumBidIncrement` call, which should be wrong

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling [Auction.setMinimumBidIncrement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L432-L440), there is no check if the system has auction ongoing.
```solidity
    function setMinimumBidIncrement(uint256 _percentage) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        if (_percentage == 0) {
            revert MIN_BID_INCREMENT_1_PERCENT();
        }

        settings.minBidIncrement = SafeCast.toUint8(_percentage);

        emit MinBidIncrementPercentageUpdated(_percentage);
    }
```
And the owner of Auction.sol can call [Auction.pause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L364-L366) at any time:
```solidity
    function pause() external onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
```

## Impact
There might be a case that:
1. there is an auction ongoing, Ada and Bob are biding for a token, current `minBidIncrement` is 10%
1. Ada calls `Auction.createBid` with 100 ETH as her offer
1. the owner(Chris) of Auction.sol calls `Auction.pause`, and then changes `minBidIncrement` from 10% to 20%
1. supposed that Bob only has 115 ETH available, if Chris doesn't change `minBidIncrement`, Bob can call `Auction.createBid` with 115 ETH, but since Chris has changed the `minBidIncrement`, Bob can't call `Auction.createBid` anymore. At the same time, it will also affect rewards
