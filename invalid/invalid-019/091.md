# [Low] User can create bid for the paused auction

## Summary
The Auction contract can be paused/unpaused by the owner. When it's paused, current implementation still allows users to create bit for the auction, which is not expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Auction contract inherits from "Pausable", and the owner can pause/unpause the auction. 
As in "settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()" function, which is allowed to be triggered only when the auction is not paused (i.e., whenNotPuased), but the "_createBid()" function can be called even when the auction is paused. As a result, user can bid for the paused auction.
## Impact
User can bid for the paused auction.
