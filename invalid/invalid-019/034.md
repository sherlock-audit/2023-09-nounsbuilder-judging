# isContract modifier can work incorrectly

## Summary

The `isContract` function can bypass.

## Vulnerability Detail

The isContract function, widely employed in multiple contracts, it check for code size to understand if given address is contract or not.

## Impact

Address.isContract() is not a reliable way of checking if the input is a contract.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is advisable to refrain from using the isContract function.

```solidity
if (ERC721TokenReceiver(_to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, _from, _tokenId, "") != ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector) revert INVALID_RECIPIENT();
```

In this if statement, the condition `Address.isContract(_to)` should be removed. Checking whether the address can receive ERC721 is sufficient.
