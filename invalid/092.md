# A user can keep extending an auction until it is in his favour

## Summary
In method `_createBid()` if **(auction.endTime - block.timestamp) < settings.timeBuffer** then auction time gets extended by **settings.timeBuffer**. A malicious user can keep extending the auction time until it has the highest bid. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The settlement only happens after auction ends. A malicious user can keep extending the auction. If `minBidIncrement` is 0 then a user can bid with same value and increment the auction for infinite number of times.

## Impact
If auction endTime keeps on increasing then this auction will not end and a new one will no start. The owner will have to pause() the contract and settle the auction.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        unchecked {
            extend = (auction.endTime - block.timestamp) < settings.timeBuffer;

            if (extend) {
                auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + settings.timeBuffer);
            }
        }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There can be a check that same user can't bid over its own bid. Also add a check that **minBidIncrement is > 0 or msgValue > lastHighestBid**
