    function _settleAuction() private {
        // Get a copy of the current auction
        Auction memory _auction = auction;

        // Ensure the auction wasn't already settled
     @>   if (auction.settled) revert AUCTION_SETTLED();

        // Ensure the auction had started
        if (_auction.startTime == 0) revert AUCTION_NOT_STARTED();

        // Ensure the auction is over
        if (block.timestamp < _auction.endTime) revert AUCTION_ACTIVE();
