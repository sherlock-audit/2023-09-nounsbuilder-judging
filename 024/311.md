# mintFromReserveTo can mint tokens reserved for founders to anyone

## Summary
In `Token.sol`, `mintFromReserveTo` can mint any reserve tokens to anyone, regardless if the tokenId was reserved for a founder.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function mintFromReserveTo(address recipient, uint256 tokenId) external onlyMinter nonReentrant {
	
	if (tokenId >= reservedUntilTokenId) revert TOKEN_NOT_RESERVED();	  
		
	// @audit does not check if tokenId is reserved for recipient	
	_mint(recipient, tokenId);
}
```

`mintFromReserveTo` does not check who the tokenId is reserved for, and allows a tokenId to be minted to someone else other than the reserved recipient. 

While the function can only be called by Minter, such a critical function should have guards in place to prevent minting a reserved token to a wrong address. 
## Impact
Scenario 1: A Minter could mint a founder-reserved tokenId to a wrong recipient (another founder or user) by accident. 

Scenario2: When analysing the MerkleReserveMinter contract, due to a lack of double hashing and possibility of a second pre-image attack, it is possible for attacker to bypass the `verify` function and then mint tokens to himself through `mintFromReserveTo`. If there are guards in place in `mintFromReserveTo` to only allow reserved tokens to be minted to correct founder, then it would prevent such an attack.

Add this foundry test to `Token.t.sol` and observe that tokenId 40 meant for `founder` can be minted to `founder2`. 
```solidity
function test_mintToWrongFounder() public {	
	uint256 _reservedUntilTokenId = 50;	
	deployAltMock(_reservedUntilTokenId);	  
	
	(address wallet40,,) = token.tokenRecipient(40);	
	assertTrue(wallet40 == address(founder));	  
	
	address _minter = vm.addr(0x1234);	
	TokenTypesV2.MinterParams[] memory minters = new TokenTypesV2.MinterParams[](1);	
	TokenTypesV2.MinterParams memory p1 = TokenTypesV2.MinterParams({ minter: _minter, allowed: true });	
	minters[0] = p1;		  
	
	vm.prank(address(founder));	
	token.updateMinters(minters);	  
	
	vm.startPrank(minters[0].minter);	
	
	// minter can mint tokenId 40, meant for founder, to founder2	
	token.mintFromReserveTo(founder2, 40);
	
	assertTrue(token.ownerOf(40) == founder2);
}

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check that if tokenId is unreserved mint to `recipient`, otherwise mint to assigned wallet.
```solidity
if (tokenRecipient[tokenId].wallet == address(0)) {
	_mint(recipient, tokenId);
} else {
	_mint(tokenRecipient[tokenId].wallet, tokenId);
}
```
