# owner of token won't be able to disable a minter

## Summary
owner should be able to toggle if an account is a minter or not via `Token.updateMinters()` function but this won't be so.
## Vulnerability Detail
Token owner won't be able to disable a minter via `Token.updateMinters()`.

This is because of this check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L468-L469) in the `Token.updateMinters()` function. 
```solidity
if (minter[_minters[i].minter] == _minters[i].allowed) continue;
```

So if the minter is enabled, he can't be disabled. 

This makes the minter immutable and opens up a possible attack path where a compromised account acting as a minter can't be disabled.
## Impact
If a minter's account is compromised the owner of token won't be able to disable him as a minter, this is risky and a lot of things could go wrong.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the check
```solidity
if (minter[_minters[i].minter] == _minters[i].allowed) continue;
```
So that owner would be able to disable an account from being a minter
