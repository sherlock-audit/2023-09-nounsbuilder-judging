# [Medium] It's possible to set address(0) as owner for all children of Ownable contract

## Summary
It's possible to set address(0) as owner for all children of Ownable contract - Token, Manager, etc.

## Vulnerability Detail
Ownable's [transferOwnership()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/utils/Ownable.sol#L63-L65) have no checks for zero address. 

## Impact
Adding address(0) as the owner will make the contract unownable, and the core functionality of the contract will be inaccessible.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    /// @notice Forces an ownership transfer from any sender
    /// @param _newOwner New owner to transfer contract to
    /// @dev Ensure is called only from trusted internal code, no access control checks.
    function _transferOwnership(address _newOwner) internal {
        emit OwnerUpdated(_owner, _newOwner);

        _owner = _newOwner;

        if (_pendingOwner != address(0)) delete _pendingOwner;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add check for address(0)
