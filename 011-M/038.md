# Founders receiving excessive amount of tokens upon each mint due to incorrect checks at _isForFounder function

## Summary
the `while` loop inside `_mintWithVesting` function checks if `tokenId` is assigned to a founder or not, it does at `_isForFounder` function by calculating the `tokenId mod 100` which always yields a value between `0-100` regardless of `tokenId` value (or ` reservedUntilTokenId + settings.mintCount++`) . however the yielded token id might be belong to a founder, this means each time `_tokenId` (not `tokenId mod 100`) is minted to the founder.

## Vulnerability Detail
to better understand the issue, take a look at this code (written using forge).

## Impact
Due to this issue, founders will receive additional number of tokens (up to 99 tokens) whenever the `_mintWithVesting` function is called, whereas the user only receives 1.
