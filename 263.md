# Part of users might lose their NFTs permanently after ````L2Migration````

## Summary
After ````L2Migration````, current design utilizes ````MerkleReserveMinter```` for users to claim NFTs back on L2.  Smart wallet users would encounter issues in this design.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue here is that if members of the origin DAO are smart contract wallets such as the widely used Gnosis safe wallet, these is no guarantee that users also control the same wallet address on L2. The address on L2 might belong to others, or even doesn't exist at all.
```solidity
File: src\minters\MerkleReserveMinter.sol
66:     struct MerkleClaim {
68:         address mintTo; // @audit a smart wallet address might belong to others or doesn't exist at all on L2
70:         uint256 tokenId;
72:         bytes32[] merkleProof;
73:     }

```

## Impact
Part of users might lose their NFTs permanently after ````L2Migration````

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe make a new design that allow users to do cross chain NFT transfers by
1) burn on L1
2) send a cross chain message
3) mint NFT on L2 to a target address specified by the sender
