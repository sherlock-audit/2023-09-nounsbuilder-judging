# Auction can be forcefully paused

## Summary

According to the [EIP-150](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md) call opcode can consume as most 63/64 of parent calls' gas. That means token.mint() can fail since there will be no gas.

This will pause the auction, which has to be restarted by governance. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Following issue was reported in the previous audit, which was later determined as invalid:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder-findings/issues/719

The issue describes the possibility of mint reverting due to lack of gas and causing the contract to be paused.
This is possible because mint() can mint up to 100 tokens in one call, consuming more then 63/64 of parent contracts calls gas.
The issue was later invalidated because in the old version the contract was catching only string errors, which does not include out of gas.

The current version does not only catch string errors:

```solidity
       } catch {
            // Pause the contract if token minting failed
            _pause();
            return false;
        }
```

This makes the before described attack possible.
Following POC is slightly modified from the POC provided by alex in the old issue:

## Recommendation

Catch only string errors / add a check for gasLeft(); at the start of createAuction();
