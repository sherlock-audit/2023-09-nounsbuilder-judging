# Malicious DOS by pausing contract

## Summary
Due to [EIP150](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150) introduction of the 63/64 gas rule, it is possible to DOS the `Auction.sol` by repeatedly pausing it. This is done through providing the correct amount of gas when calling `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` that would cause `_createAuction -> token.mint()` to fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
Same bug from previous contest remains unfixed, and is not listed as a known issue:
[https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-15-malicious-pausing-the-contract](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-15-malicious-pausing-the-contract)
Essentially,  `_createAuction` does a `try-catch` to call `token.mint()`. If the `try` call fails due to insufficient gas, the `catch` block is triggered which pauses the contract. 

The bug is exploitable if `token.mint()` uses more than 1.5 mil of gas because 1.5mil / 64 is > 20,000 which is the amount of gas needed to pause the contract. This is achievable when roughly 20 tokens are being minted to founders. 
## Impact
As `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` can be called by anyone, an attacker can potentially keep pausing the auction contract, which requires a DAO vote to call `unpause()` causing major inconvenience and possibly permanent DOS of the auction.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before calling `token.mint()` check that sufficient gas being forwarded so that the mint will not fail due to a lack of gas. This could be stored in a `minGas` variable.
