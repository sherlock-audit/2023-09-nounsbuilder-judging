# _handleOutgoingTransfer can be gas griefed by a malicious user

## Summary

When bidding is in progress, the highest bidder will refund the previous bidder using a low-level call. If the previous bidder is a contract, he can control how much gas needs to be used, up to a maximum of 50000. This means that the new highest bidder will have to pay ~50,000 gas everytime he wants to override the bid

## Vulnerability Detail

The highest bidder has the responsibility to refund the bid that was overtaken, through `_handleOutgoingTransfer()`

```solidity
    function _handleOutgoingTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) private {
        // Ensure the contract has enough ETH to transfer
        if (address(this).balance < _amount) revert INSOLVENT();

        // Used to store if the transfer succeeded
        bool success;

        assembly {
            // Transfer ETH to the recipient
            // Limit the call to 50,000 gas
            success := call(50000, _to, _amount, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        }
```

The refund uses a low level call that limits the gas to 50,000. A griefer can bid in the auction using a contract address, and set its receive() function to a loop that wastes 50,000 gas. The new highest bidder has to pay an extra 50,000 gas for nothing.

In the griefer's contract address:

```solidity
receive() external payable {
  // Have a while loop that just simply uses up gas
  // When low level call is called to the address, receive() is invoked, which will run the while loop and use ~50,000 gas.
  // Make sure it doesn't use more than 50,000 otherwise the low level call will just revert and the WETH else clause will be carried out
Â 
}
```

## Impact

Griefing the bidder by letting the highest bidder pay unnecessary gas fees.

## Recommendation

Instead of asking the highest bidder to refund the previous bidder, just place all the funds in the contract. If a bidder is overtaken, then he can draw his funds out of the contract.

Always make sure that the user doesn't interact with another user. Use the contract as the intermediary.
