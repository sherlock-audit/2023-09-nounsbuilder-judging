# The founder can obtain DAO NFTs before the auction and mint new DAO NFTs after the DAO has been initialized

## Summary

Before transferring ownership, the founder can set any address as a minter, allowing them to mint DAO NFTs in advance before auction through this minter. Even after DAO initialization, the old minter is not immediately removed, allowing the founder to exploit the old minter to mine DAO NFTs for their own profit.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can become a founder by deploying a DAO, and once the DAO is initialized, ownership will be transferred to the Treasury contract. Before this ownership transfer, the founder remains the owner of the Token, retaining the ability to set any address as a minter.

```solidity
    function updateMinters(MinterParams[] calldata _minters) external onlyOwner {
        // Update each minter
        for (uint256 i; i < _minters.length; ++i) {
            // Skip if the minter is already set to the correct value
            if (minter[_minters[i].minter] == _minters[i].allowed) continue;

            emit MinterUpdated(_minters[i].minter, _minters[i].allowed);

            // Update the minter
            minter[_minters[i].minter] = _minters[i].allowed;
        }
    }
```

The minter ROLE has the authority to mint NFTs without restrictions, including NFTs intended for auction and reserved NFTs. This implies that the founder can mint DAO NFTs before transferring ownership without any limitations.
Furthermore, minting reserved NFTs typically incurs fees if `pricePerToken` is greater than zero. However, the minter can bypass these fees by calling [`mintFromReserveTo`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L211).

```solidity
function mintFromReserve(address tokenContract, MerkleClaim[] calldata claims) public payable {
        MerkleMinterSettings memory settings = allowedMerkles[tokenContract];
        uint256 claimCount = claims.length;

        // Ensure claims are not empty
        if (claimCount == 0) {
            revert INVALID_CLAIM_COUNT();
        }

        // Check sale end
        if (block.timestamp > settings.mintEnd) {
            revert MINT_ENDED();
        }

        // Check sale start
        if (block.timestamp < settings.mintStart) {
            revert MINT_NOT_STARTED();
        }

        // Check value sent
        if (msg.value < _getTotalFeesForMint(settings.pricePerToken, claimCount)) {
            revert INVALID_VALUE();
        }

        // Mint tokens
        unchecked {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < claimCount; ++i) {
                // Load claim in memory
                MerkleClaim memory claim = claims[i];

                // Requires one proof per tokenId to handle cases where users want to partially claim
                if (!MerkleProof.verify(claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot, keccak256(abi.encode(claim.mintTo, claim.tokenId)))) {
                    revert INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF(claim.mintTo, claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot);
                }

                // Only allowing reserved tokens to be minted for this strategy
                IToken(tokenContract).mintFromReserveTo(claim.mintTo, claim.tokenId);
            }
        }

        // Distribute fees if minting fees for this collection are set (Builder DAO fee does not apply to free mints)
        if (settings.pricePerToken > 0) {
            _distributeFees(tokenContract, claimCount);
        }
    }
```

Furthermore, as per the [documentation](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/nouns-builder/creating), once a DAO has been initialized, only a passed proposal can alter the contract.
However, during the initialization of the DAO, the old minter is not removed. Even though governance has the ability to delete the old minter through a proposal, the old minter can still mint new NFTs before its removal.

> The Treasury contract is set as the owner since it is the contract that executes transactions based on governance votes. Once a DAO has been initialized the founders are no longer able to directly change the contracts and must have a proposal pass governance to do so.


## Impact

The founder can obtain DAO NFTs before the auction and mint new DAO NFTs after the DAO has been initialized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to disable token mining operations before initializing the DAO, and remove any additional minters during DAO initialization.
