# Auction is never actually settled and thus new auction can't be created.

## Summary
In the ``_settleAuction()``, ``Auction`` is loaded into memory and ``auction.settled`` is set to ``true``. But that value will never be updated as the ``_auction`` variable is loaded to memory and not storage.

## Vulnerability Detail
This will prevent creation of new auction when this contract is paused. It's because in the ``unpause()`` , in case of second auction, in the else if block, It checks the value of ``auction.settled`` and then creates a new auction using ``_createAuction()`` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L357-L360).

But due to above vulnerability, ``auction.settled`` will never be equal to ``true`` and hence the ``_createAuction()`` can never be reached in the ``unpause()``.

## Impact
New auction can't be created in case of contract pause and thus the high severity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change this code snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L246

to this:
```solidity
./auction/Auction.sol

246:    Auction storage _auction = auction;
```
