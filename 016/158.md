# # Auction.sol : Token and bid amount will be lost when contract is paused

## Summary

Bid amount and token  will be stuck in the contract if the contract is paused during bidding

## Vulnerability Detail

When the contract is unpaused, a new auction is started and a new token is minted and previous auction state is cleared in function `_createAuction` even though the previous auction was not settled.

So the previous auction bid amount and tokenId will be stuck in the contract

## Impact

Bid amount of a user and token will be stuck in the contract

```solidity
    function unpause() external onlyOwner { 
        _unpause();

        // If this is the first auction:
        if (!settings.launched) {
            // Mark the DAO as launched
            settings.launched = true;

            // Transfer ownership of the auction contract to the DAO
            transferOwnership(settings.treasury);

            // Transfer ownership of the token contract to the DAO
            token.onFirstAuctionStarted();

            // Start the first auction
            if (!_createAuction()) {
                // In cause of failure, revert.
                revert AUCTION_CREATE_FAILED_TO_LAUNCH();
            }
        }
        // Else if the contract was paused and the previous auction was settled:
        else if (auction.settled) {
            // Start the next auction
            _createAuction();
        }   
    }

    /// @notice Pauses the auction house
    function pause() external onlyOwner {  
        _pause();
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an else block in `unpause` to settle and start new auction if previous auction is not settled
