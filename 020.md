# User can create a bid for exactly the same amount as the lastHighestBid and be the highestBidder

## Summary
Due to a rounding down issue in Auction.createBid(), any user that send in the exact msg.value as the last highest bid can claim the highestbidder place.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Auction.createBid() if lastHighestBidder is != address(0) the minBid is computed using the following formula: 
minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100);
For example if:
- lastHighestBid = 30;
- settings.minBidIncrement = 2;
- then ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100) = ((30*2)/100) = 0.6 but due to truncation issue solidity will return 0;
- finally we get: minBid= 30+0 = 30 instead of normally returning 30.6;
- minBid will get rounded down to zero and minBid will be equal to lastHighestBid;
- So if an user send msg.value = lastHighestBid he will successfuly pass this check
```solidity
 if (msgValue < minBid) {
                revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
            }
```
and will claim the lastHighestBidder spot

## Impact
User will claim hihestBidder spot without sending actual msg;value < lastHighestBid
