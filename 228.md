## Summary
regarding these docs: 
https://hackmd.io/@Vc6Y6iquTg2mutFXPZq08Q/ryT9U9vG6

we can read that BuilderDao rewards and Referral rewards are to be set to a static percentage which is immutable.

As of now the code provides no percentage number therefore it is impossible to know calculate the totalbps and more in this function:
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lays in that no one knows what the percentage of `referralRewardsBps` and `builderRewardsBps` will be  
## Impact
this could lead to unexpected loss of funds, bid rewards not being calculatd properly, see the code snippet where both variables are used countless of times without any knowledge on how much the percentage should be, remember that it has to be static according to the docs.
