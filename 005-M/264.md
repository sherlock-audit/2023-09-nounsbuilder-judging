# Merkle leaf values are 64 bytes before hashing which can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary

Leaf values are 64 bytes long prior to hashing

## Vulnerability Detail

`MerkleProof.sol` puts the following warning at the beginning of the contract:

```comment
* WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
```

`MerkleReserveMinter.sol` uses `claim.mintTo` and `claim.tokenId` as the base of the leaf:

```solidity
if (!MerkleProof.verify(claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot, keccak256(abi.encode(claim.mintTo, claim.tokenId)))) {
            revert INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF(claim.mintTo, claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot);
 }
```

`claim.mintTo` is a 20-byte address and `claim.tokenId` is a 32-byte uint256, resulting in a total of 52 bytes. However, `abi.encode` pads this to a multiple of 32 bytes, so it becomes 64 bytes.


## Impact

The size of a leaf is the same size of the parent data that is hashed, both are 64 bytes. As a result it is possible to have a hash collision between a leaf and any node in the tree. This allows for proofs to be repeated multiple times by taking subtrees as leaves.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using `leaf = keccak(abi.encodePacked(claim.mintTo, claim.tokenId))` in `mintFromReserve()` as this will reduce the size of the leaf data being hashed to 52 bytes. This will prevent a collision between a leaf and other nodes in the tree.

```solidity

if (!MerkleProof.verify(claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(claim.mintTo, claim.tokenId)))) {
    revert INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF(claim.mintTo, claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot);
}
```
