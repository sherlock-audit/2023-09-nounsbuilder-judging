# Sending two minimum bids in the same block

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
line 223 Auction.sol
Regarding the possibility of sending two minimum bids in the same block, it depends on how the code is being executed and how transactions are being managed in your specific blockchain environment. In Ethereum, for example, transactions are grouped into blocks and executed sequentially. If two transactions are sent in the same block and both meet the conditions described in the code, then yes, both could be reverted due to the condition revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();

## Code Snippet

            if (msgValue < minBid) {
                revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
            }
            // Ensure that the second bid is not also zero
            if (minBid == 0 && msgValue == 0 && lastHighestBidder != address(0)) {
                revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
            }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a timestamp check or nonce verification for bids. If two minimum bids occur in the same block, reject the second bid to maintain integrity and prevent conflicts.
