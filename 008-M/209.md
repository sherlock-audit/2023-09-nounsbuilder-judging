# Token may not be rendered after new metadata render is set to the token

## Summary
Token may not be rendered after new metadata render is set to the token.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a token is minted, [onMinted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/metadata/MetadataRenderer.sol#L242) function is called upon mint to generate attributes for the token.
```solidity
        // Store the total as reference in the first slot of the token's array of attributes
        tokenAttributes[0] = uint16(numProperties);


        unchecked {
            // For each property:
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < numProperties; ++i) {
                // Get the number of items to choose from
                uint256 numItems = properties[i].items.length;


                // Use the token's seed to select an item
                tokenAttributes[i + 1] = uint16(seed % numItems);


                // Adjust the randomness
                seed >>= 16;
            }
        }
```

However, metadata render can be replaced by token owner through [setMetadataRenderer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/manager/Manager.sol#L172) function.

This could lead to all the tokens minted before the replacement losing all their attributes, as the attributes is stored in the old `MetadataRenderer` contract, and it's not possible to re-add the attributes to the tokens, because `onMinted` function can only be called by `Token` contract, and there is no entry point to do so.

## Impact
Token can not be rendered.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add entry point in `Token` contract to re-add attributes to the tokens.
