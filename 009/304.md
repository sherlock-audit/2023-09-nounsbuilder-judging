# MerkleReserveMinter susceptible to second preimage attack

## Summary
In `MerkleReserveMinter.mintFromReserve()` the leaf value is 64 bytes long prior to hashing due to use of `abi.encode(address, uint)`, resulting in possible collisions with internal nodes of the merkle tree. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`MerkleReserveMinter.sol` uses OpenZeppelin's library for MerkleProof. The [library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol#L13) clearly states that:
```md
* WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
* hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
* This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
* the merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
```

But `MerkleReserveMinter.sol` uses abi.encode(address, uint256) resulting in a 64 bytes leaf values. This could collide with an internal node that concatenates two 32 bytes hashes. 
```solidity
 if (!MerkleProof.verify(claim.merkleProof, settings.merkleRoot, keccak256(abi.encode(claim.mintTo, claim.tokenId)))) // <------- @audit
```

Furthermore, the leaf is not double-hashed as recommend by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/README.md#:~:text=The%20leaves%20are%20double%2Dhashed), making it even more vulnerable to second preimage attack which can be read about [here](https://www.rareskills.io/post/merkle-tree-second-preimage-attack) and [here](https://flawed.net.nz/2018/02/21/attacking-merkle-trees-with-a-second-preimage-attack/)

## Impact
It is possible that a malicious attacker may be able to abuse the merkle tree collisions to mint reserve tokens to another address.

Submitted as medium severity as attack is challenging in practice due to `address` which is 20 bytes will be encoded with 12 leading zeroes, which an intermediate hash may not have. However, if it occurs then the consequences are severe as a reserved tokenId could be minted to a wrong address. 

Worthy to also note that `mintFromReserve` does not have any checks against minting a reserved `tokenId` to another address that is not the assigned address, which allows the attack to be carried out more easily. This was submitted as a separate finding.  

A similar medium finding was found in a Sherlock [report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/300) and C4 [report](https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-04-merkle-leaves-are-the-same-length-as-the-parents-that-are-hashed-code4rena-factorydao-factorydao-contest-git). The NounsBuilder impact is arguably greater and more likely given that `MerkleReserveMinter` is intended to be used widely by many DAOs with different settings.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use abi.encodePacked() instead and apply a double keccak256 hash.
