## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The used to update settings functions of the `Auction` contract are guarded with `whenPaused` modifier. But the current auction should be also considered as ongoing while it has not received `settled` status.


## Impact
The auction parameters can be changed during ongoing auction, and take effect immediately. Users may need time to react to the changes. The impacts maybe followings:
- some sudden changes may cause bidderâ€™s transaction fail, such as setReservePrice() and setMinimumBidIncrement()
- some changes may change users expectation about the auction, such as setDuration() and setTimeBuffer(), with different time parameters, bidders will use different strategy
