# [Medium] Auction parameters can be changed during ongoing auction

## Summary
This issue have been noticed during the previous [audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-16-auction-parameters-can-be-changed-during-ongoing-auction) .

## Vulnerability Detail
The only thing that have been added was **whenPaused** modificator that wouldn't help because contract can be paused during ongoing auction without a problem.
```solidity
function setReservePrice(uint256 _reservePrice) external onlyOwner whenPaused
```

## Impact
Changes may change users expectation about the auction, such as [setTimeBuffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L424-L428), with different time parameters.
It can affect User's auction strategy and etc.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /// @notice Updates the time duration of each auction
    /// @param _duration The new time duration
    function setDuration(uint256 _duration) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        settings.duration = SafeCast.toUint40(_duration);

        emit DurationUpdated(_duration);
    }

    /// @notice Updates the reserve price of each auction
    /// @param _reservePrice The new reserve price
    function setReservePrice(uint256 _reservePrice) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        settings.reservePrice = _reservePrice;

        emit ReservePriceUpdated(_reservePrice);
    }

    /// @notice Updates the time buffer of each auction
    /// @param _timeBuffer The new time buffer
    function setTimeBuffer(uint256 _timeBuffer) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        settings.timeBuffer = SafeCast.toUint40(_timeBuffer);

        emit TimeBufferUpdated(_timeBuffer);
    }

    /// @notice Updates the minimum bid increment of each subsequent bid
    /// @param _percentage The new percentage
    function setMinimumBidIncrement(uint256 _percentage) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        if (_percentage == 0) {
            revert MIN_BID_INCREMENT_1_PERCENT();
        }

        settings.minBidIncrement = SafeCast.toUint8(_percentage);

        emit MinBidIncrementPercentageUpdated(_percentage);
    }

    /// @notice Updates the founder reward recipent address
    /// @param reward The new founder reward settings
    function setFounderReward(FounderReward calldata reward) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        // Ensure the founder reward is not more than max
        if (reward.percentBps > MAX_FOUNDER_REWARD_BPS) revert INVALID_REWARDS_BPS();

        // Ensure the recipient is set if the reward is greater than 0
        if (reward.percentBps > 0 && reward.recipient == address(0)) revert INVALID_REWARDS_RECIPIENT();

        // Update the founder reward settings
        founderReward = reward;

        emit FounderRewardUpdated(reward);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict pausing for the ongoing contract to ensure that this fix works.
