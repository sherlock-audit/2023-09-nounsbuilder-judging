# Auction Settings Can Be Changed During The Launching Auction

## Summary
The significant auction settings can be changed immediately during the launching auction, resulting in unexpected changes to auction settings for bidders.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Auction` contract allows the owner to set the essential auction parameters when the contract is paused:

- [setDuration() L408-412](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L408-L412)
- [setReservePrice() L416 - 420](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L416-L420)
- [setTimeBuffer() L424-428](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L424-L428)
- [setMinimumBidIncrement() L432 - 440](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L432-L440)

**Although these parameters can be changed in the `pause` state, these changes will immediately affect the auction, Bidders can still participate in the auction regardless of whether the contract is paused or not**, as the [createBidWithReferral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L144-L147) or [createBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L151-L154) allow bidding regardless of the contract's **`pause`** status.

## Impact
**Auction parameters can be changed immediately, leading to unexpected modifications to auction settings for bidders.** Some bidder might not notice the changes since they take effect suddenly, and they can significantly impact the auction such as:

- The **`settings.duration`** and **`settings.timeBuffer`** can impact the auction behavior.
- The **`settings.reservePrice`** and **`settings.minBidIncrement`** can impact the auction bid price for bidders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider the contract pause status in the create bid processes ([createBidWithReferral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L144-L147) and [createBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L151-L154) to not allow participation in the auction when the contract is paused by applying the **`whenNotPaused`** modifier to both [createBidWithReferral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L144-L147) and [createBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L151-L154).
- Consider not applying auction setting changes to the launching auction.
- Consider applying the TimeLock for any changes to auction settings to introduce a gap in time for bidders to notice the changes.
