# [Medium] Auction's setDuration() and setTimeBuffer() doesn't have value validation that can lead to endless auction.

## Summary
Part of this issue have been noticed during the previous [audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-06-proposals-can-be-bricked-and-auctions-stalled-by-bad-settings) .
In result the only thing that have been added was **whenPaused** modificator that wouldn't help because contract can be paused during ongoing auction without a problem.

## Vulnerability Detail
Duration and timeBuffer used in [_createAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L292-L329) and [_settleAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L244-L289).


## Impact
In case if setDuration() or setReservePrice() will be updated by mistake for a big amount of time - for example year. Auction will stuck until that time without options to stop it.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setDuration(uint256 _duration) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        settings.duration = SafeCast.toUint40(_duration);

        emit DurationUpdated(_duration);
    }

    /// @notice Updates the reserve price of each auction
    /// @param _reservePrice The new reserve price
    function setReservePrice(uint256 _reservePrice) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        settings.reservePrice = _reservePrice;

        emit ReservePriceUpdated(_reservePrice);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Add validation for auction duration and timeBuffer.
