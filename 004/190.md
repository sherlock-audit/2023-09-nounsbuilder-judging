# Wasting gas fees because of overflowing auction endTime

## Summary

When creating an auction, the `endTime` can overflow if the contract caller makes a mistake in setting the `duration`, resulting in unncessary gas expenses for the auction creator and their possible bidders. If a check is made before, the user can avoid starting an auction that effctively ends before the `startDate`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Creating an auction sets the `endTime` in the following code section which can be found in the `_createAuction` function in Auction.sol:

```solidity
    // Cache the current timestamp
    uint256 startTime = block.timestamp;
    
    // Used to store the auction end time
    uint256 endTime;
    
    // Cannot realistically overflow
    unchecked {
        // Compute the auction end time
        endTime = startTime + settings.duration;
    }
    
    // Store the auction start and end time
    auction.startTime = uint40(startTime);
    auction.endTime = uint40(endTime);
```

There is a comment stating that this value cannot realistically overflow, but there is no actual prevention mechanism in place to stop this overflow from happening. The comment is based on the assumption that the contract caller does not make any mistakes when setting the `duration`, but mistakes do happen. Nothing stops the user from wasting funds on a transaction where an abnormally high auction duration is set, resulting in an `endDate` that overflows. Token minting is a prerequisite for starting the auction, so that is another operation that will run, wasting even more gas.

```solidity
    /// @dev Creates an auction for the next token
    function _createAuction() private returns (bool) {
        // Get the next token available for bidding
        try token.mint() returns (uint256 tokenId) {
```

Making a check, so creating an already finished auction cannot happen, would help with avoiding unpleasant situations where even more gas is wasted by bidders trying to place bids on an auction that has already ended, as per this code section in the `_createBid` function in Auction.sol:

```solidity
    // Ensure the auction is still active
    if (block.timestamp >= auction.endTime) {
        revert AUCTION_OVER();
    }
```

## Impact

The auction creator will end up paying gas for minting a token and creating an auction that is effctively already ended, while bidders might start bidding and getting their transactions reverted as well because this auction has already ended.

## Code Snippet

The auction `duration` is set in the `initialize` method, without any checks regarding its value:

The `_createAuction` method will succeed even with an overflowing `endDate` as seen in its code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L291-L329

Bidders might end up spending gas on transactions that get reverted because the auction is effctively finished because the `endDate` overflowed:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend validating the value of the auction `duration` in the `initialize` function, ensuring that it is not higher than something like 10 or 100 years. Even if 100 years is an unreasonable auction duration, the only purpose of this check is to make sure the `endDate` will not overflow, something like:

```solidity
    if (settings.duration > MAX_AUCTION_DURATION) {
        revert DURATION_TOO_HIGH();
    }
```
