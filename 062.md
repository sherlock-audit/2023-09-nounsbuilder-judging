# Unverified Ownership Transfer

## Summary
The current implementation of code transfers ownership of the contract without verifying the acceptance of the new owner, creating a potential security risk of unauthorized control.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the "unpause" function, the code transfers ownership of the auction contract and the token contract to a new owner without checking if the new owner has actually accepted the new ownership. This could potentially lead to unauthorized control of these important contracts.

## Impact
If the new owner is a malicious actor, they could take over the contract and manipulate it to their advantage, causing potential losses for other users who interact with these contracts.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L345-L348

```solidity
// Transfer ownership of the auction contract to the DAO
transferOwnership(settings.treasury);

// Transfer ownership of the token contract to the DAO
token.onFirstAuctionStarted();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A function should be added to confirm whether the newly intended owner has accepted ownership before transferring ownership.

Here is the code to fix the issue:

```solidity
if (settings.treasury.confirmOwnership()){
    transferOwnership(settings.treasury);
}
```

This confirmOwnership() function should return true when the intended owner (i.e., settings.treasury) confirms the acceptance of new ownership. The implementation of this function will depend on the logic of the settings.treasury contract.

For these changes to take place, settings.treasury contract must include confirmOwnership function to express acceptance. Make sure that this function is adequately protected from misuse.
