# current Auction bidder will lose his funds if migration to L2 happens in the middle of an Auction

## Summary
according to the docs, DAO can decide to migrate to L2 by pausing the Auction and then generating a snapshot of all the current holders and then sending a transaction to L2, to mint those snapshot in L2 by merkle tree minter. the issue is that even when the Auction is paused there may be current Auction and the snapshot will not contain that auction winner. the migration should happen when there is no current active auction and Auction is paused and this wasn't mentioned in the DOCs. so the highest bidder will lose his funds when the migration happens.

even if DAO owners wants to settle the current auction they need to unpause the Auction contract that would give everyone access to call `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` and start another auction.

## Vulnerability Detail
this the migration process that sponsors expalined:

as you can see it was assumed that if Auction is paused then it's okey to create a snapshot of NFT owners and create migration transaction but this will cause current auction highest bidder to lose his funds. because he is going to receive his NFT in L1 while it is worthless.

This is the `createBid()` code, as you can see it's callable if the Auction is paused:
```javascript
    function createBid(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
        currentBidReferral = address(0);
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }
```

This is the `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` code, as you can see if Auction is not paused, then anyone can call it and start another auction.
```javascript
    /// @notice Settles the current auction and creates the next one
    function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _settleAuction();
        _createAuction();
    }
```


## Impact
current auction highest bidder will lose his funds if migration happens in the middle of an auction. pausing the Auction won't be enough to start migration.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
explicitly mention in the docs that there should not be current ongoing auction when the migration happens.
