# totalRewards can be greater than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`, which makes the if condition under _settleAuction to always revert

## Summary
 Auction._computeTotalRewards function used to compute the total rewards for a bid, this function is used to set builder reward, referral reward and founder reward in case if it was enabled after initializing array for the recipients and amounts, this function calculate `totalBPS` , `totalRewards` using builder reward BPS , referral reward BPS and final bid amount and return RewardSplit struct.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue in this function is that it do not check if the _finalBidAmount * totalBPS is greater than the BPS_PER_100_PERCENT instead it checks the totalBPS, 

```solidity

 // Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }

        // Calulate total rewards
        split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;

```
 As from above we can see that the total split reward can still be greater than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT` because it only checks the totalBPS, and (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) could be greater than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`.
 Suppose their is a condition, where the above checks `` if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) `` get passed and the move to the next calculation to calculate the split rewards now here their might be high probability that `(_finalBidAmount * totalBPS)` is greater than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT` , let's take a condition in which ```totalBPS = X (slightly lesser than BPS_PER_100_PERCENT)``` and ```_finalBidAmount = Y``` now in the calculation of total split rewards :
``` split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;```  their can be some values which can trigger `(_finalBidAmount * totalBPS)` this multiplication and result in value greater than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`.
## Impact
total split rewards can be 0 due to precision loss and due to this value the function can be prone to DOS attack , therefore the value get after precision will continue to flow in the entire contract that make use of split rewards like in  ``_settleAuction`` internal function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for total split rewards to ensure that totalReward could never be greater than `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`,
```solidity
if ((_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT ) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }
```
