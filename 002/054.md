# More rewards are being sent to the rewardsManager.

## Summary
We do not account for `rounding` in the `_computeTotalRewards` function. 
This oversight may lead to sending slightly more funds to the `rewardsManager` than the correct rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_computeTotalRewards` function, we calculate the `rewards` for the `builder`, `referrer`, and `founder`.
```solidity
 function _computeTotalRewards(
    address _currentBidRefferal,
    uint256 _finalBidAmount,
    uint256 _founderRewardBps
) internal view returns (RewardSplits memory split) {
    uint256 totalBPS = _founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS;
    split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
    split.amounts[0] = (_finalBidAmount * builderRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
    split.amounts[1] = (_finalBidAmount * referralRewardsBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
    split.amounts[2] = (_finalBidAmount * _founderRewardBps) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
}
```
Subsequently, we deposit `split.totalRewards` to the `rewardsManager`, along with the reward information for individual `recipients`.
```solidity
if (split.totalRewards != 0) {
    rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
}
```
Here, `split.totalRewards` should be equal to the sum of `split.amounts`. 
While the details of `ProtocolRewards` are beyond the current scope, the `depositBatch` function would revert if `split.totalRewards` differs from the sum of `split.amounts`. 
Although an ideal implementation would involve an accompanying function in the `ProtocolRewards` contract to withdraw excess funds, the exact details are not provided.
```solidity
function depositBatch(address[] calldata recipients, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes4[] calldata reasons, string calldata comment) external payable {
   if (msg.value != expectedTotalValue) {
      revert INVALID_DEPOSIT();
  }
}
```

Allow me to provide an example. 
Suppose `_founderRewardBps` is `30`, `referralRewardsBPS` is 10,`builderRewardsBPS` is `10` and `_finalBidAmount` is `222222`.
```solidity
split.totalRewards = _finalBidAmount * 50 / 100 = 111111
split.amounts[0] = _finalBidAmount * 10 / 100 = 22222
split.amounts[1] = _finalBidAmount * 10 / 100 = 22222
split.amounts[2] = _finalBidAmount * 30 / 100 = 66666
sum of split.amounts = 111110 < split.totalRewards
```


## Impact
Despite the small excess quantity, it has the potential to cause the deposit function to `revert` or accumulate funds that cannot be utilized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please update the calculation of `totalRewards`.
```solidity
- split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
+ split.totalRewards = split.amounts[0] + split.amounts[1];

if (hasFounderReward) {
    split.recipients[2] = founderReward.recipient;
    split.amounts[2] = (_finalBidAmount * _founderRewardBps) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
    + split.totalRewards += split.amounts[2];
}
```
