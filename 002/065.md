# Auction cannot be settled & funds stuck because of Rounding error in Rewards calculation

## Summary

The Auction for new DAO Tokens has to be settled, when its time has elapsed. During settlement, rewards to the Builder, Founder and Referral are calculated and deposited to the Rewards Contract. Because of rounding Issues, this call can revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Auction.sol contract there is a function that settles the latest auction, when it is over.
Inside this function there is call to `_computeTotalRewards` to calculate the rewards split, based on the configured reward percentages and the winning bid. 

Inside of `_computeTotalRewards`, first the total rewards are calculated like this:

```typescript
        uint256 totalBPS = _founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS;
...
        split.totalRewards = (_finalBidAmount * totalBPS) / BPS_PER_100_PERCENT;
```

Later the single rewards are calculated on their own in a similar way, by multiplying the finalBid by the rewardsBPS and dividing it by `BPS_PER_100_PERCENT`. 

It is notable, that in each of these calculations, the result might be rounded down, because Integer Math is used. Because of this, the calculation of `split.totalRewards` might not end up as the actual sum of all the actual rewards, that are calculated.

When these values are returned to `_settleAuction` the `depositBatch` function of the rewardsManager is called like this: 

```typescript
     rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
```

Here we can see, that `split.totalRewards` is used as the value, that is passed to the function, and the recipients and amounts are passed as parameters.

As mentioned before, there is a likely chance for  `split.totalRewards` to be greater, than the actual sum of `split.amounts`. This is a problem, because if we take a look into the actual implementation of the [rewardsManager contract](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/blob/994773a82186d9c10beb017c51173ef1f9bc5cc2/packages/protocol-rewards/src/ProtocolRewards.sol#L46) we can see that there is a check for the passed value to match the sum of all the passed amounts, and that it is reverting if that is not the case:

```typescript
uint256 expectedTotalValue;

        for (uint256 i; i < numRecipients; ) {
            expectedTotalValue += amounts[i];

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        if (msg.value != expectedTotalValue) {
            revert INVALID_DEPOSIT();
        }
```

Therefore, if this happens, the Auction contract remains in a locked state, where the current auction cannot be settled!

Example:

If we have all 3 rewards (Referral, Builder, Founder)  at 10% ('1000') 
The latest bid of `1_000_005`.

`split.totalRewards` will round down to `300.001` (30% of bid)
and the individual rewards will all be `100.000`.

But then we are sending more then we have to pay:
Expected total value will be `300.000 = 3 * 100.000` but total rewards will be `300.001`.
Therefore the transaction will revert.


We created a PoC for this, it can be run by applying the following diff to `test/Auction.t.sol` and run `forge test --match-test RoundingError -vv`

## Impact

- Loss of funds for latest bidder:  cannot get Token, nor refund
- Auction contract is locked: Not possible to settle Auction, or create new Auction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate the totalRewards as the actual sum of the rewards instead of  using the sum of the percentages.
