# highest bidder fund may be locked because totalBPS check is in wrong place

## Summary
function `_settleAuction()` settles the current auction and in doing so it sends the rewards for referral, builder and founders. to calculate rewards code calls `_computeTotalRewards()` which checks that `totalBPS < 100%` and if it's not, then it reverts the transaction. the issue is that the check for `totalBPS` should have be done when the value of the rewards, especially has been `founderRewardBps` set.
in current implementations, the auction won't get settled and highest bidder funds would be locked. malicious DAO or by mistake can cause this issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `_computeTotalRewards()` code, as you can see when `totalBPS > 100%` code reverts. so this is steps that makes this issue happen:
```javascript
    function _computeTotalRewards(
        address _currentBidRefferal,
        uint256 _finalBidAmount,
        uint256 _founderRewardBps
    ) internal view returns (RewardSplits memory split) {
        // Get global builder recipient from manager
        address builderRecipient = manager.builderRewardsRecipient();

        // Calculate the total rewards percentage
        uint256 totalBPS = _founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS;

        // Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }
```

This is were `founderReward` has been set:
```javascript
    /// @notice Updates the founder reward recipent address
    /// @param reward The new founder reward settings
    function setFounderReward(FounderReward calldata reward) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        // Ensure the founder reward is not more than max
        if (reward.percentBps > MAX_FOUNDER_REWARD_BPS) revert INVALID_REWARDS_BPS();

        // Ensure the recipient is set if the reward is greater than 0
        if (reward.percentBps > 0 && reward.recipient == address(0)) revert INVALID_REWARDS_RECIPIENT();

        // Update the founder reward settings
        founderReward = reward;

        emit FounderRewardUpdated(reward);
    }
```
as you can see there is no check that `totalBPS = founderRewardBps + referralRewardsBPS + builderRewardsBPS` is less than 100%.
a malicious founder or DAO can increase the `founderRewardBps` so that `totalBPS > 100%` in the middle of the auction and then the highest bidder funds would be locked in the contract.
code shouldn't allow the `founderRewardBps` to set to high value in the setter function. there is a check to make sure that value is less than `MAX_FOUNDER_REWARD_BPS` but that's not enough, there should be a check for `totalBPS` too.

## Impact
highest bidder funds can be locked if founder's rewards BPS changed during an auction. malicious founder can lock users funds.

## Recommendation
check `totalBPS` in founder's reward bps setter function.
