# Wrong totalBPS check

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When the auction is concluded, the rewards are calculated using the [_computeTotalRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L465-L508) function. The calculation involves three types of rewards, founder rewards, referral rewards, and builder rewards. As per the documentation, the founder rewards have a cap of 0-30%, while the other two types of rewards remain static. 


In case there is any unallocated reward, it is supposed to be sent to the treasury. 

```solidity
// If the highest bid included ETH: Pay rewards and transfer remaining amount to the DAO treasury
            if (highestBid != 0) {
                // Calculate rewards
                RewardSplits memory split = _computeTotalRewards(currentBidReferral, highestBid, founderReward.percentBps);

                if (split.totalRewards != 0) {
                    // Deposit rewards
                    rewardsManager.depositBatch{ value: split.totalRewards }(split.recipients, split.amounts, split.reasons, "");
                }

                // Deposit remaining amount to treasury
                _handleOutgoingTransfer(settings.treasury, highestBid - split.totalRewards);
            }
```

However, the current implementation enforces sending rewards to the treasury.
```solidity
// Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS >= BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }
```
The function should only revert when the total BPS exceeds 100%.
## Impact
It is not possible to create auctions with a [reward percentage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/db232c649b425c36f5a93607c95cfdf0e5962b2f/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L474) of one hundred percent.

## Recommendation
```solidity
// Verify percentage is not more than 100
        if (totalBPS > BPS_PER_100_PERCENT) {
            revert INVALID_REWARD_TOTAL();
        }
```
