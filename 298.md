# `Token.mint, burn, mintTo` has wrong access control implementation

## Summary

`Token.mint, burn, mintTo` can't be called by minter role

## Vulnerability Detail

- The functions of Token.sol's `mint()`, `mintTo()`, `burn()`, `mintBatchTo` implement `onlyAuctionOrMinter` modifier which should check if the caller is either Auction contract or someone with minter role.
- However the caller with minter role cant call, because of the logic used in that modifier which checks `&&` operation instead of `||` operation.
- So if a minter calls, the function will revert in first half of that logic that doesnt pass `msg.sender != settings.auction`, so use `||` instead and validate with OR operation.

## Impact

Severity : Medium. (Wrong access control implementation)

## Code Snippet

From [Token.onlyAuctionOrMinter :: modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L45)

```javascript
    modifier onlyAuctionOrMinter() {
        if (msg.sender != settings.auction && !minter[msg.sender]) {
            revert ONLY_AUCTION_OR_MINTER();
        }

        _;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff

    modifier onlyAuctionOrMinter() {
-       if (msg.sender != settings.auction && !minter[msg.sender]) {
+       if (!(msg.sender == settings.auction || minter[msg.sender])) {
            revert ONLY_AUCTION_OR_MINTER();
        }

        _;
    }
```
