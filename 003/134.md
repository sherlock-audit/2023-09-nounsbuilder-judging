# Claimers Funds Sent in Excess for Minting are Not Refunded

## Summary
Claimers do not receive refunds for overpayment, as the [`mintFromReserve`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/minters/MerkleReserveMinter.sol#L129-L173) function lacks a mechanism to refund excess Ether sent by caller.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`mintFromReserve`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/minters/MerkleReserveMinter.sol#L129-L173) function enables the claimer to pay the total fee for minting tokens from the reserve using a merkle proof. However, **this function lacks a refund mechanism for any excess Ether sent by the caller**.

## Impact
Excess funds are locked in the `Treasury` contracts, and only the owner of the `Treasury` contract can manually refund them to the claimer. 

Furthermore, there is no tracking of the excessive funds for each claimer, making it difficult to verify and provide proof that the claimer should receive the refunds and determine the amount of their locked funds.
