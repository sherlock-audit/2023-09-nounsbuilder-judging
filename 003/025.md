# Excess Ether Handling in `mintFromReserve` Function of MerkleReserveMinter Contract

## Summary
The `mintFromReserve` function of the `MerkleReserveMinter` contract does not refund excess Ether sent by users. Instead, it transfers any overpaid amount, after deducting the Builder DAO fee, to the treasury. This behavior may not be clear to users and could lead to unintentional loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `mintFromReserve` function, the contract calculates the total fees required for minting using `_getTotalFeesForMint`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/minters/MerkleReserveMinter.sol#L184-L187

```solidity
    function _getTotalFeesForMint(uint256 pricePerToken, uint256 quantity) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // If pricePerToken is 0 the mint has no Builder DAO fee
        return pricePerToken > 0 ? quantity * (pricePerToken + BUILDER_DAO_FEE) : 0;
    }
```
If a user sends more Ether than this calculated amount, the contract does not issue a refund. The excess Ether, minus the Builder DAO fee, is sent to the treasury in the `_distributeFees` function. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/minters/MerkleReserveMinter.sol#L189-L208

```solidity
    function _distributeFees(address tokenContract, uint256 quantity) internal {
        uint256 builderFee = quantity * BUILDER_DAO_FEE;
        uint256 value = msg.value;

        (, , address treasury, ) = manager.getAddresses(tokenContract);
        address builderRecipient = manager.builderRewardsRecipient();

        // Pay out fees to the Builder DAO
        protocolRewards.deposit{ value: builderFee }(builderRecipient, hex"00", "");

        // Pay out remaining funds to the treasury
        if (value > builderFee) {
            (bool treasurySuccess, ) = treasury.call{ value: value - builderFee }("");

            // Revert if treasury cannot accept funds
            if (!treasurySuccess) {
                revert TRANSFER_FAILED();
            }
        }
    }
```
This approach can result in users unintentionally overpaying without any means of recovering their excess funds.

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users may lose funds unintentionally, leading to a negative experience and possible distrust in the system.
- **Risk of User Error**: There is a higher risk of user error, especially for those unfamiliar with the exact fee structure.
- **Potential for Exploitation**: Malicious actors could exploit this by tricking users into overpaying.
- **Legal and Ethical Concerns**: Automatically keeping overpaid funds might not align with legal and ethical standards in certain jurisdictions.

While the contract functions correctly from a technical standpoint, the potential financial impact on users and the associated legal and ethical considerations raise the severity of this issue.

Note: This may have been prevented in the UI and/or when interacting users checking `getTotalFeesForMint` function. However, average users who are not familiar with direct smart contract interactions might not use this function. The risk of overpayment persists for them, e.g. when interacting from etherscan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Here is a suggested refactoring of the mintFromReserve function to prevent overpayments:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/minters/MerkleReserveMinter.sol#L148-L151

```diff
        // Check value sent
-        if (msg.value < _getTotalFeesForMint(settings.pricePerToken, claimCount)) {
+        if (msg.value != _getTotalFeesForMint(settings.pricePerToken, claimCount)) {
            revert INVALID_VALUE();
        }
```
