# Different Pragma

## Summary
It is not good practice to use the different pragma (multiple ) in the contract . It is better to use the same pragma across the contract as which lead to  different bugs and security checks .  

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/interfaces/IUUPS.sol#L2
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/interfaces/IWETH.sol#L2C1-L2C25
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;
```

```solidity 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/utils/OPAddressAliasHelper.sol#L2
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
```

Can check here ^0.8.16  and ^0.8.13 is used but on other filed 0.8.16 version is used . 


## Impact
Using multiple versions of Solidity can make maintenance and testing more difficult. It can be challenging to ensure that all contracts are compatible with all versions of the compiler, and to test each contract with each version of the compiler

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Same solidity version should be used across the contract. This same practice is also recommended by secureum bootcamp
