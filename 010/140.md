# Is is still possible to create bids when contract is paused

## Summary

User can call `createBid` in `Action` contract even when the contract is paused. This means that user could create the bid while some changes are being made to the contract state variables.

## Vulnerability Detail

Contract owner could start the auction, pause it and then change the parameters of `reservePrice` or `minBidIncrement`. User can still create the bid using previous values even when the contract is paused. It's a exmaple flow. There are many possibilities that could give user an advantage. It is a good practise that when the contract is paused, no actions that modify state, can be made.

## Impact

```solidity
    /// @notice Creates a bid for the current token
    /// @param _tokenId The ERC-721 token id
    function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
        currentBidReferral = _referral;
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }

    /// @notice Creates a bid for the current token
    /// @param _tokenId The ERC-721 token id
    function createBid(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
        currentBidReferral = address(0);
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }
```

User can bypass new state variables by front-running the admin's transaction. He could benefit from this action when the new values would offer much worse bidding opportunities.

For example `minBidIncrement` change from initial 10% to 15%.

## Recommendation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier to `createBidWithReferral` and `createBid`.
