# Unsafe NFT transfer

## Summary

Using `ERC721.transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()` may cause the user's NFT to be frozen in a contract that does not support ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_settleAuction()` there is `_auction.highestBidder` that can be a smart contract.

However, if `_auction.highestBidder` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

## Impact

The NFT may get stuck in the contract that does support ERC721.
