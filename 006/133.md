# Use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()` for ERC721 transfer, it's safe since protected by `nonReentrant` modifier

## Summary
Developers protected function with `nonReentrant` modifier so using `safeTransferFrom()` is safe, I believe developers makes typo, they should use `safeTransferFrom()`

OpenZeppelin recommends safeTransferFrom() to ensure the recipient can handle ERC721 tokens. Although nonReentrant is used, which reduces reentrancy risks, safeTransferFrom() adds an additional layer of safety by confirming the recipient's capability to handle ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation uses `transferFrom()` to transfer ERC721 tokens. This method does not trigger the `onERC721Received()` hook in the recipient contract, potentially leading to issues if the recipient is a contract designed to interact with ERC721 tokens. This could result in ERC721 tokens being locked in a contract that cannot interact with them.

## Impact
Using `transferFrom()` can lead to situations where ERC721 tokens are transferred to contracts that are not prepared to handle them, potentially causing the tokens to be locked permanently.

## Recommendation
Replace `transferFrom()` with `safeTransferFrom()` in the `_settleAuction` function.
