# updateFounders Function in Token.sol could set a zero owner to a founder

## Summary
A medium vulnerability could be setting the zero address as founder by the owner of the contract
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/token/Token.sol#L375C63-L375C74
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `updateFounders `is intended to update the founder details in the _Token.sol_ contract. A critical aspect of this function is its handling of founder addresses, particularly zero addresses (**address(0)**). The expectation was that the function would revert when a founder with a zero address is passed, indicating a refusal to accept invalid addresses.
## Impact
The absence of a revert in the scenario where a founder with a zero address is passed indicates that the function might accept zero addresses.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function test_RejectZeroAddressFounder() public {
        IManager.FounderParams[] memory newFoundersArr = new IManager.FounderParams[](1);
        newFoundersArr[0] = IManager.FounderParams({
            wallet: address(0),
            ownershipPct: 10,
            vestExpiry: 2556057600
        });

        vm.prank(founder);
        vm.expectRevert(); // It should revert but the test passed
        token.updateFounders(newFoundersArr);
    }
```
## Tool used
Foundry
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is strongly recommended to update the updateFounders function to explicitly reject founder entries with zero addresses.
