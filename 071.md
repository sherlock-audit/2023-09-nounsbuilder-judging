# The Manager contract will call any external function

## Summary
The `manager` contract will call any external contract, because the `token` address in the `setMetadataRenderer` function is not necessarily trustworthy, which will bring huge risks to users.
## Vulnerability Detail
Although the function `setMetadataRenderer` checks whether the `owner` of the token is `msg.sender`, it does not determine whether the token is legal.

An attacker can create a malicious `token` contract, which contains the `owner` function and the `setMetadataRenderer` function and runs normally. Obviously this is not the original meaning of this function.
