# Hardcoded gas costs may be insufficient

## Summary
Gas costs should not be hardcoded
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_handleOutgoingTransfer` function makes a call with a hardcoeded amount of gas, 50,000. If the recipient is a contract, this may be insufficient to process the transaction. As a result the recipient would be unable to receive funds from this function.

Also changes in network, forks can result in repricing of opcodes which can make opcodes less expensive, which would re-introduce the opportunity for re-entrancy (already protected) that the old costs prevented or more expensive, which can lead to wrong accounting for incurred gas costs and break the function altogether 

## Impact
Reciever might not be able to recieve funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the gas amount, or Initializing it in the initializer and adding setter functions to be able to update them in case of an EVM fork.
