# Exploitable Auction Discounts via Self-Designated Referrals

## Summary
Auction winner who `createBidWithReferral()` and set themselves as `_referral` are able to win auction at a discounted rate.

## Vulnerability Detail
In auctions, users have two ways to bid: `createBid()` and `createBidWithReferral()`, where assigning oneself as `_referral` grants a portion of the final auction price as a reward. An issue arises when a bidder uses `createBidWithReferral()` and designates themselves as `_referral`. The auction winner gains the ability to withdraw `referralRewardsBPS` from `ProtocolRewards.sol`.
```solidity
    function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
        currentBidReferral = _referral;
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }
```
Consider the following scenario:

1. referralRewardsBPS = 15% and minBidIncrement = 10%.
2. The ongoing highest bid stands at 1 ETH with no designated `_referral`.
3. An attacker employs `createBidWithReferral()` designating themselves as `_referral` for 1.1 ETH.
4. The attacker wins the bid but gains 0.165 ETH as `referralRewardsBPS`.
5. The attack secures the bid at 0.935 ETH, a cheaper rate than the previous highest bidder.

## Impact
Auctions can be won at cheaper rate than previous highest bid.

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function createBidWithReferral(uint256 _tokenId, address _referral) external payable nonReentrant {
+      require(_referral != msg.sender);
        currentBidReferral = _referral;
        _createBid(_tokenId);
    }
```
