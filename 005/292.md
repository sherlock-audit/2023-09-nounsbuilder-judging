# Bidder can skip referral and builder fee, by self referring

## Summary

When creating a bid, there is a fee that is payed to the referral. If no referral is set, this is paid to the builders. A bidder can prevent paying this fee, by setting himself as his own referral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Auction.sol there is a function to create a Bid with or without referral. But the fees, that have to be paid are always the same. In case there is no referral, the fee is paid to the founders. 
But when a bidder is creating a new Bid, he can set himself as a referral. Therefore, the fee will be paid to himself, effectively skipping it.

## Impact

Bidder can skip referral/builder fee.
