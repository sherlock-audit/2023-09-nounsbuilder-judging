# Bidder Can Set Themselves as Referral for Financial Gain

## Summary
Bidder can set their own address as the referral. This allows them to unfairly benefit from the referral reward, reducing the income for the treasury and compromising the auction's integrity.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract's createBidWithReferral function does not prevent bidders from using their own address as a referral. This loophole lets a bidder receive part of the bid amount back as a referral reward, essentially allowing them to bid at a lower net cost.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to reduced earnings for the treasury and undermine the auction's fairness. It creates an incentive for bidders to exploit the system for personal gain, which can discourage honest participation.

## Code Snippet

PoC:
```solidity
    function test_BidderSetSelfAsRefferal() public {
        deployMock();
        vm.prank(manager.owner());
        manager.registerUpgrade(auctionImpl, address(rewardImpl));

        vm.prank(auction.owner());
        auction.upgradeTo(address(rewardImpl));

        vm.prank(founder);
        auction.unpause();
        
        uint256 bidder1BalanceBefore = bidder1.balance;
        vm.prank(bidder1);
        auction.createBidWithReferral{ value: 1 ether }(2, bidder1);
        assertEq(bidder1, auction.currentBidReferral());

        vm.warp(10 minutes + 1 seconds);
        auction.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction();

        assertEq(address(treasury).balance, 0.93 ether);
        assertEq(MockProtocolRewards(rewards).balanceOf(bidder1), 0.04 ether);

        vm.prank(bidder1);
        MockProtocolRewards(rewards).withdraw(bidder1, 0.04 ether);
        assertEq(bidder1.balance, bidder1BalanceBefore - 1 ether + 0.04 ether);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, add a require statement in the createBidWithReferral function to ensure the bidder cannot be their own referral:
```solidity
require(msg.sender != _referral, "Auction: bidder can't be referral");
```
```bash
Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/AuctionAudit.t.sol:AuctionTest
[FAIL. Reason: Auction: bidder can't be referral] test_BidderSetSelfAsRefferal() (gas: 3674193)
```
_Note: While this fix addresses the immediate issue, malicious users could still use a secondary account as a referral._
