# Denial of Service via ETH Transfer Handling in `Auction.sol`


## Summary
The `_handleOutgoingTransfer` function relies on external calls to transfer ETH which if reverted could lock funds in the contract. This can block core auction functionality.

## Vulnerability Details:
The `_handleOutgoingTransfer` function uses a low level `call` to send ETH:
```solidity
function _handleOutgoingTransfer(address payable to, uint value) internal {
  (bool success,) = to.call{value:value}("");
  require(success);
}
```
If `to` /  `lastHighestBidder` is a contract reverting this call, it will block the ETH transfer leading to denial of service.

This function is used to refund bidders when new higher bids are created through `createBid` or` createBidWithReferral` function:
```solidity
function _createBid() external payable {
// code
  _handleOutgoingTransfer(lastHighestBidder, lastHighestBid);

// code
}
```
If `_handleOutgoingTransfer`'s call reverts, bidder refunds will be blocked, preventing new legitimate bids.

## Impact
Reverts in _handleOutgoingTransfer can lead to:

- Locked ETH in contract
- Failure to refund bidders
- Prevention of future bids

Blocking bidding and auction settlement.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a pull-payment pattern:
```solidity
function withdrawRefund() external {
  (bool sent,) = msg.sender.call{value: refunds[msg.sender]}("");
  require(sent);
}
```
This avoids reliance on push transfers succeeding.
