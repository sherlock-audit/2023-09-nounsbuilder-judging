# ERC721 contract lacks some safety measures compared to the OZ ERC721 contract

## Summary

The current ERC721.sol is modified from ERC721Upgradeable from OpenZeppelin. However, some important safety measures are not correctly modified, which will compromise the current ERC721.sol contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two main issues in the current ERC721.sol contract, which is modified from OZ ERC721Upgradeable (version <0.5.0).

Firstly, the transferFrom function in the current ERC721.sol does not check for reentrancy after `_beforeTokenTransfer()`

Current Implementation:

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) public {
        if (_from != owners[_tokenId]) revert INVALID_OWNER();

        if (_to == address(0)) revert ADDRESS_ZERO();

        if (msg.sender != _from && !operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] && msg.sender != tokenApprovals[_tokenId]) revert INVALID_APPROVAL();

        _beforeTokenTransfer(_from, _to, _tokenId);

        unchecked {
            --balances[_from];
```

OZ implementation:

```solidity
     address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) internal virtual {
        require(ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer from incorrect owner");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC721: transfer to the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId, 1);

        // Check that tokenId was not transferred by `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook
        require(ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer from incorrect owner");

        // Clear approvals from the previous owner
        delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId];
```

This statement is missing in the current ERC721.
```solidity
        require(ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer from incorrect owner");
```

Secondly, there is no safeMint option in the current ERC721. This means that the user minting the ERC721 token is not checked whether it is a EOA or contract. If the user is a contract and intends to mint an ERC721 token in the current implementation, it will create errors.

This statement is not added in the mint option.

```solidity
        if (
            Address.isContract(_to) &&
            ERC721TokenReceiver(_to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, _from, _tokenId, _data) != ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector
        ) revert INVALID_RECIPIENT();
``` 

In OZ Implementation, `_checkOnERC721Received()` is called in `safeMint()` and `safeTransfer()`

```solidity
    function _checkOnERC721Received(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes memory data
    ) private returns (bool) {
        if (to.isContract()) {
            try IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable(to).onERC721Received(_msgSender(), from, tokenId, data) returns (bytes4 retval) {
                return retval == IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable.onERC721Received.selector;
            } catch (bytes memory reason) {
                if (reason.length == 0) {
                    revert("ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
                } else {
                    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
                    assembly {
                        revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))
                    }
                }
            }
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
```

## Impact

The ERC721.sol contract is not as safe as the OZ implementation.

## Recommendation

Add safeMint options and check for reentrancy or any possible issues during the hook callbacks.
