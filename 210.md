# First founder(any founder) wallet can be address(0) when calling the function updateFounders.

## Summary
as there is no input validation First founder(any founder) wallet can be address(0) when calling the function updateFounders.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the function updateFounders with parameters newFounders, there is no validation of founder’s wallet address. There is no check that wallet address can’t be address(0).

When  calling the function deploy(manager contract) with  _founderParams,there is a check that Ensure at least one founder is provided i.e  if ((founder = _founderParams[0].wallet) == address(0)) revert FOUNDER_REQUIRED();

So as there is no input validation , founder’s wallet address can be mistakenly set to address(0).


## Impact
Funds can go to address(0) or token can be minted to address(0).
