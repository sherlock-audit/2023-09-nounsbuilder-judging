# `Manager.initialize()` is missing Access control

## Summary

`Manager.initialize()` is missing Access control. Anyone can initialize with attacking contract and abuse the system. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Manager.initialize() is missing access control. Only the deployer should be able to call it with right new Owner.
 Since it's a UUPS proxy, temporarily use `onlyOwner` modifer to initialize function.


## Impact

Severity : High. (Manager controls most of the system's access control)

## Code Snippet

[From Manager.sol :: Ln:74](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/manager/Manager.sol#L73)

```javascript
    function initialize(address _newOwner) external initializer {
        // Ensure an owner is specified
        if (_newOwner == address(0)) revert ADDRESS_ZERO();

        // Set the contract owner
        __Ownable_init(_newOwner);
    }
```

-   function initialize(address _newOwner) external initializer {
+   function initialize(address _newOwner) external initializer onlyOwner{
        // Ensure an owner is specified
        if (_newOwner == address(0)) revert ADDRESS_ZERO();

        // Set the contract owner
        __Ownable_init(_newOwner);
    }
