# Integer underflow can be exploited to get unlimited votes.

## Summary
``_moveDelegateVotes()`` can be exploited with integer underflow to get unlimited votes.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. ``Alice`` has two wallet addresses, ``A`` and ``B``.
2. Assume, both wallet addresses get 1,1 tokens from an auction and thus the voting power of both wallet address ``A`` and ``B`` is 1,1.
3. Wallet ``A`` delegates all its voting power to ``B`` using [delegate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L133-L135) which then calls  [_delegate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L179-L193). So, current the voting power of ``A`` is ``0`` but B is ``2``. Note that currently, the balance of both wallet ``A`` and ``B`` remains ``1,1``.
4. Upon first delegation from A to B, the ``delegation`` mapping in the ``_delegate()`` is set such that:
```solidity
delegation[A] = B;
```
5. Again, ``Alice`` with wallet address ``B``, calls the ``delegate()``, and delegate ``B`` to ``A`` such that voting power of ``A`` will be ``2`` and ``B`` will be ``0``. Again, the delegation mapping is updated such that:
```solidity
delegation[B] = A;
```
6. Again, ``Alice`` with wallet address ``B``, calls ``transferFrom`` to transfer token from ``B`` to ``A`` which then calls ``_afterTokenTransfer()`` when then again calls ``_moveDelegateVotes()`` to delegate votes from ``B`` to ``A``.  But, voting power of B is ``0`` due to previous delegation. Thus, when [_moveDelegateVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L199) gets called, the [_writeCheckpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L234) attemps to subtract, amount i.e ``1`` from ``prevTotalVotes`` i.e ``0`` Thus causing underflow and results in getting ``type(uint256).max`` votes.

## Impact
Malicious user can get unlimited votes and thus the high severity.

## Recommendation
Remove the ``unchecked`` block in [_moveDelegateVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L199).
