# Potential Vulnerability in Auction Contract - Incorrect Bid Handling

## Summary
Identified a critical vulnerability in the `createBid `function of an auction smart contract, where a malicious actor can reset the current highest bid to the reserve price calling the function createBid, potentially disrupting the auction process performing a denial-of-service (DOS) attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
The createBid function without referral could be called by anyone:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L151-L154

setting the `currentBidReferral = address(0);`

If a malicious attacker set msg.value to reservePrice, it is possible to reset the current highest bid to the reserve price because in the `if (lastHighestBidder == address(0)) {` statement there is not any check.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L156-L204

The `_createBid` function updates the `auction.highestBid `and `auction.highestBidder` based on the `msg.value` and `msg.sender` of the transaction. However, there's no check to ensure that the new bid `(msg.value)` is higher than the current highest bid `(auction.highestBid)`. This oversight allows an actor to place a bid that is lower than the current highest bid, effectively reducing the highest bid of the auction.
## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to auction manipulation where a malicious actor could repeatedly place lower bids, reducing the highest bid of the auction to an unfair value. This can also be used to perform a denial-of-service (DOS) attack, causing chaos in the auction process and potentially deterring serious bidders.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
auction.highestBid = msgValue;
auction.highestBidder = msg.sender;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to introduce a validation check in the `_createBid `function to ensure that the new bid `(msg.value)` is strictly greater than the current highest bid `(auction.highestBid)`. Implementing a conditional statement to revert the transaction if this condition is not met would mitigate the risk. For example before the if statement of `_createBid `function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L200C10-L200C10

it could be useful to add this check:

```solidity
if (msgValue < auction.highestBid) {
    revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
}
```
