# The core functionality of creating a bid is broken

## Summary

In this special case where the reserve price is zero users could just back-run each other to take the highest bidder role without increasing their bid 
 
## Vulnerability Detail

Users can use the contract `Auction.sol` to settle & create an auction or to create a bid for the current token (auction) 
This auction contract is designed to let the Owner decide the reserve price `settings.reservePrice`. This price could be zero, 
we can see these lines were devs trying to handle this case 
```solidity
File: Auction.sol
221:             // Ensure that the second bid is not also zero
222:             if (minBid == 0 && msgValue == 0 && lastHighestBidder != address(0)) {
223:                 revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
224:             }

```
```solidity
File: Auction.sol
265:             // If the highest bid included ETH: Pay rewards and transfer remaining amount to the DAO treasury
266:             if (highestBid != 0) {

```
so if  `reservePrice == 0` the auction will start from zero and if the next user wants to take the highest bidder role `auction.highestBidder` needs to increase his bid depending on this equation 
` minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100)`

But by setting `settings.reservePrice == 0`
The 2nd_user can just send 1 wei and he will be the `auction.highestBidder`
The problem in the 3th_user, he can just send the same value (1 wei) to kick out 2nd_user
This is the case until settles the current auction or someone decides to increase the current HighestBid. this is not how the auction works the next user need always to increase the bid

```solidity
File: Auction.sol

207:         } else {
208:             // Used to store the minimum bid required
209:             uint256 minBid;
210: 
211:             // Cannot realistically overflow
212:             unchecked {
213:                 // Compute the minimum bid
214:                 minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100);
215:             }

```
The issue is (see the above logic) if the `settings.reservePrice * settings.minBidIncrement < 100` ==> the `minBid == lastHighestBid`
So just bid the same amount and you will be the `auction.highestBidder`

## Impact
- The current highest bidder will lose his role and the right to win the auction and receive the NFT, to someone who bids the same amount so he just overwrites the `auction.highestBidder` address.
- The core functionality of creating a bid is broken

## Recommendation

add this check `if (minBid == lastHighestBid) revert`
