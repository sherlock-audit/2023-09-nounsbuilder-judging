# ```Auction``` can accept two identical tiny bids in some cases.

## Summary

In the [```_createBid```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L158-L197) function of the [```Auction```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol) contract, if someone places an initial bid of a few Wei, we cannot ensure that the same bid will be rejected when submitted a second time.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's Bob places an initial bid of ```1``` Wei in the [```_createBid```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L158-L197) function. This will work if ```settings.reservePrice``` is set to zero, which is theoretically possible in this contract (otherwise it will revert).

Let's now assume Alice places another bid of ```1``` Wei through the same function. The ```if (lastHighestBidder == address(0))``` condition is not met so we fall back in the ```else``` execution below.

```solidity
 // Used to store the minimum bid required
 uint256 minBid;

  // Cannot realistically overflow
  unchecked {
         // Compute the minimum bid
         minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100);
    }

    // Ensure the incoming bid meets the minimum
    if (msgValue < minBid) {
           revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
     }
     // Ensure that the second bid is not also zero
    if (minBid == 0 && msgValue == 0 && lastHighestBidder != address(0)) {
        revert MINIMUM_BID_NOT_MET();
    }

    // Refund the previous bidder
     _handleOutgoingTransfer(lastHighestBidder, lastHighestBid);
```

This part will run with no problem if settings.minBidIncrement is lesser or equal than 99 as in this case we will have ```minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100) = 1 + ((1 * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100) = 1``` as ```1 * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100``` rounds down to zero.

In this case, the new bidder will become ```highestBidder``` and ```lastHighestBidder``` will get his bid refunded and be unable to win the auction despite having placed the exact same bid. 

## Impact

This vulnerability means the ```Auction``` will not always be fair. Note that in this case the ```highestBid``` also does not have to be increased by ```minBidIncrement``` despite what is written in the docs (```Also, a bid must be equal to or greater than the minBidIncrement amount which is set to 10% in the DAO by default```).

As the potential loss / cost of opportunity is tiny in this case, it only harms the supposed functioning of the contract. We then qualify this vunerability as MEDIUM.

## Code Snippet

Below is the [```_createBid```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L158-L197) function of the [```Auction```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol) contract

```solidity
function _createBid(uint256 _tokenId) private {
        // Ensure the bid is for the current token
        if (auction.tokenId != _tokenId) {
            revert INVALID_TOKEN_ID();
        }

        // Ensure the auction is still active
        if (block.timestamp >= auction.endTime) {
            revert AUCTION_OVER();
        }

        // Cache the amount of ETH attached
        uint256 msgValue = msg.value;

        // Cache the address of the highest bidder
        address lastHighestBidder = auction.highestBidder;

        // Cache the last highest bid
        uint256 lastHighestBid = auction.highestBid;

        // Store the new highest bid
        auction.highestBid = msgValue;

        // Store the new highest bidder
        auction.highestBidder = msg.sender;

        // Used to store whether to extend the auction
        bool extend;

        // Cannot underflow as `_auction.endTime` is ensured to be greater than the current time above
        unchecked {
            // Compute whether the time remaining is less than the buffer
            extend = (auction.endTime - block.timestamp) < settings.timeBuffer;

            // If the auction should be extended
            if (extend) {
                // Update the end time with the additional time buffer
                auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + settings.timeBuffer);
            }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This behavior can be easily avoided by setting a minimum value for ```reservePrice``` to make sure ```minBid = lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100);``` is greater than ```lastHighestBid``` even when ```minBidIncrement``` is set to the minimum value of 1 percent.

This means modifying the initializer as per below:

```solidity
function initialize(
        address _token,
        address _founder,
        address _treasury,
        uint256 _duration,
        uint256 _reservePrice,
        address _founderRewardRecipient,
        uint16 _founderRewardBps
    ) external initializer {
        // Ensure the caller is the contract manager
        if (msg.sender != address(manager)) revert ONLY_MANAGER();

        // Ensure the founder reward is not more than max
        if (_founderRewardBps > MAX_FOUNDER_REWARD_BPS) revert INVALID_REWARDS_BPS();

        // Ensure the recipient is set if the reward is greater than 0
        if (_founderRewardBps > 0 && _founderRewardRecipient == address(0)) revert INVALID_REWARDS_RECIPIENT();

        // Initialize the reentrancy guard
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();

        // Grant initial ownership to a founder
        __Ownable_init(_founder);

        // Pause the contract until the first auction
        __Pausable_init(true);

        // Store DAO's ERC-721 token
        token = Token(_token);

        // Store the auction house settings
        settings.duration = SafeCast.toUint40(_duration);
        settings.reservePrice = INITIAL_RESERVE_PRICE;
        settings.treasury = _treasury;
        settings.timeBuffer = INITIAL_TIME_BUFFER;
        settings.minBidIncrement = INITIAL_MIN_BID_INCREMENT_PERCENT;

        // Store the founder rewards settings
        founderReward.recipient = _founderRewardRecipient;
        founderReward.percentBps = _founderRewardBps;
}
```

with 

```solidity
uint8 private immutable INITIAL_RESERVE_PRICE = 100;
```

and then ensure that this value cannot be decreased by modifying the [```setReservePrice```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-nounsbuilder/blob/main/nouns-protocol/src/auction/Auction.sol#L416-L420) function

```solidity
function setReservePrice(uint256 _reservePrice) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
        require(_reservePrice >= INITIAL_RESERVE_PRICE, "minimum reserve price not met");
        settings.reservePrice = _reservePrice;

        emit ReservePriceUpdated(_reservePrice);
}
```

In this case and if the first bid has been placed, we will have ```lastHighestBid + ((lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement) / 100 >= lastHighestBid + 1``` as by the steps above we ensured ```lastHighestBid * settings.minBidIncrement >= 100```
